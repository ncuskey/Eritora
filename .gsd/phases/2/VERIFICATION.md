## Phase 2 Verification

### Must-Haves
- [x] **Restoration of all missing content and assets**
  - Audit confirmed no missing *pages*.
  - Audit identified 1 missing *image* (`Pasted image 20260124123736.png`).
  - Broken link in `Spirit Naga.md` was FIXED.

### Verdict: PASS (with minor note)
We have addressed the requirements:
1. Identified gaps (only 1 image missing).
2. Fixed broken links.
3. Confirmed no page loss.

The missing image requires user input (source file needed), but the system is otherwise restored.
