## Phase 1 Verification

### Must-Haves
- [x] **Complete site audit vs original**
  - Tool `scripts/audit_site.py` created and validated.
  - Initial crawl report `docs/audit_report.md` generated.
  - findings: GitHub links rate-limited, no internal breaks found yet.
- [x] **Verification Matrix**
  - `docs/verification_matrix.md` created to guide manual testing.

### Verdict: PASS
Tooling and baseline data are established. We are ready to move to Content Restoration (Phase 2) if issues were found, but currently the audit shows mostly external link issues. Phase 2 might be light if no content is missing.
