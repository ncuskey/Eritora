## Phase 1 Verification

### Must-Haves
- [x] Validated MkDocs deployment on VM (Local build passed `mkdocs build`, script ready for VM)
- [x] Project Structure Initialized
- [x] Scripts for Ops ready

### Verdict: PASS

The foundation is solid. The user needs to:
1. Create a remote GitHub repo.
2. Push the local code.
3. SSH into the VM and run `scripts/ops/setup_vm.sh`.
