# Content Gap Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the findings from Phase 2: Content Restoration audits.

## 1. Orphaned Content
**Status**: CLEAN (After excluding report files)
- No actual content pages are missing from the sitemap.
- The only files flagged were `verification_matrix.md` and `audit_report.md` (which are documentation artifacts, not wiki content).

## 2. Source Integrity
**Status**: 1 Issue Remaining
- **Fixed**: `Spirit Naga.md` link to `Nightmare.md` has been corrected.
- **Missing Asset**: `1. Adventurer's Hub/Characters/Character Creation.md` references `../../Images/Pasted image 20260124123736.png` which does not exist in `docs/Images/`.

## Action Items
1. [ ] Locate or recreate `Pasted image 20260124123736.png` and place it in `docs/Images/`.
   - *Impact*: Low (one missing image on Character Creation page).
