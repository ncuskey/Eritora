"Turnbuckle’s first legend, and its first warning."

**Era:** [[Old Turnbuckle]] (before the town became a destination)  
**Where:** [[Turnbuckle Town]] in the [[Amorpha Mountains]], built around a modest [[Arcanite]] mine 
**Threat:** A rising goblin coalition and the plan later remembered as the [[FireStorm]] 

Long before Turnbuckle was a valley city, it was a tight mountain settlement that survived by routine and grit. The mine paid wages, the weather set limits, and danger was normal in the way it becomes normal when you have no alternative. Valinthor was one of the guards who kept that normal from tipping into panic. He wasn’t born into greatness. He was shaped by a place that demanded a certain kind of person: practical, awake, and stubborn.

When goblin activity began to shift from raids to coordination, Valinthor recognized the difference. The FireStorm was not a single battle at first. It was an emerging strategy: pressure on supply routes, timed hits on watch rotations, deliberate attempts to exhaust the town’s limited defenders. The most terrifying version of the plan—repeated in later accounts—suggests the mine itself was meant to become the focal point of the catastrophe, turning Turnbuckle’s livelihood into its funeral pyre. 

Valinthor became the person who insisted the town take the threat seriously. He rallied miners into militias, redistributed watch schedules, forced rival families into cooperation, and hardened the settlement into something that could withstand a coordinated assault. In the stories, this is where he becomes a savior. In truth, this was also where he became dangerous.

Because Valinthor was not only driven by protection. He was driven by fear, anger, and an obsession with control. He slept little. He distrusted outsiders. He pushed people past their limits because he believed the storm would be worse than any exhaustion he could cause. Some loved him for it. Some never forgave him. Turnbuckle remembers the hero; it forgets the strain he inflicted to create that hero.

The FireStorm came anyway. The goblin coalition moved, and the valley answered with the defenses Valinthor had built. In the telling most people accept, Valinthor “stopped the FireStorm before it could begin,” not because there was no war, but because he prevented the kind of single decisive devastation the plan depended on. The town fought in pieces instead of being consumed all at once. Supply lines held. Watch gaps were fewer. The mine did not become the center of a spectacular ending.

Valinthor’s death is the hinge of the legend. The popular version says he sacrificed himself so the town could live. That part is true in the broad sense. But the exact shape of it is contested. Some accounts describe a last stand meant to buy time for evacuation. Others describe a deliberate choice to draw the coalition’s attention away from the mine. A few quiet voices argue something harder: that Valinthor did not just die for the town, he died because he could no longer see any other way to end what he had helped create—an escalation that had started to mirror the ruthlessness of the enemy.

After the FireStorm, Turnbuckle did what surviving places always do: it turned the pain into story. Valinthor’s name became a banner. The conflict became a symbol. The later commercialization of adventuring in Turnbuckle leaned on that symbol until it felt like destiny. The [[Crown of Valinthor]] exists because a town learned that legends attract people, and people bring money. 

But under the crown and the banners is a more complicated inheritance: Valinthor’s courage, yes—also his intensity, his suspicion, his willingness to make costs feel inevitable. In Turnbuckle, that legacy shows up in how the town talks about danger as if it can be scheduled and sold.

## What People Still Argue About
- Did Valinthor save Turnbuckle… or did he save the mine because the mine was Turnbuckle? 
- Was the FireStorm truly a single plan, or a name given later to many ugly months?
- Was Valinthor’s sacrifice the final act of a hero—or the final act of a man who couldn’t live with what the war demanded?

## Adventure Seeds
- A hidden ledger of Valinthor’s orders surfaces, and it reads less like heroism and more like a man at war with himself.
- An old tunnel in the mine is found sealed from the inside, with markings that suggest the FireStorm reached closer than the stories admit.
- A modern [[CAd]] recreates “the FireStorm route” for tourists—until it begins matching the real pattern too closely.
