"Fog, ferries, and arrivals that don’t want to be seen."

**Known For:** ferry crossings on [[The Dewmist River]], warehouses, boat crews, river guides  
**Vibe:** damp, efficient, secretive, and always listening

South Docks is where Turnbuckle breathes in. Ferries slide through the fog on [[The Dewmist River]], crews shout in half-codes, and everything smells like wet rope and old wood. The docks run on timing. Miss the right boat and you wait. Miss the wrong boat and someone notices.

This is the district that understands movement: goods, people, rumors, and mistakes. Teams arriving by river look different than teams arriving by road. They’re quieter, more deliberate, and often better informed. Guides here don’t sell glory. They sell clean routes and safe tie-offs.

South Docks is also full of spaces that look boring on purpose. Warehouses with false walls. Storage lockers that don’t appear in ledgers. Offices that do paperwork for someone else’s name. If you need discretion, you come here. If you need attention, you go somewhere else.

[[The Dewmist]] itself feels like part of the district. The fog can hide you, but it can also trap you. Old dockhands swear the river learns. They also swear it answers.
