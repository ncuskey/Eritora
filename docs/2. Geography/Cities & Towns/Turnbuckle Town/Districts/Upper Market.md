"Clean stalls, clean prices, clean lies."

**Known For:** premium goods, sponsor boutiques, certified equipment, curated branding  
**Vibe:** polished, expensive, controlled, and quietly competitive

Upper Market is where Turnbuckle pretends it’s a respectable city. The stalls are spaced for comfort, the signage is tasteful, and the goods come with certificates. This is where sponsored teams shop so the photos look right. This is where wealthy visitors buy “authentic” gear that has never seen mud.

Upper Market sells the feeling of preparedness. Everything is labeled, everything is curated, and nothing is allowed to look desperate. If Lower Market is about survival, Upper Market is about reputation. Vendors here know how to smile while judging you. They know what brands are trending. They know which [[CAd]] company is in favor.

There’s real quality here, but it’s paired with performance. The best items cost more because they include the story you’ll tell about them. Some shops even offer “pre-scuffed” equipment for teams who want to look seasoned without earning it.

Under the polish, Upper Market is ruthless. Rival vendors sabotage each other with rumors. Sponsors pressure shops for exclusivity. And if a scandal starts, the Market closes ranks fast.

**Landmarks**
- The certification kiosks (stamps, seals, and smiling inspectors)
- The sponsor row (boutiques tied to company brands)
- The quiet cafés (where negotiations happen over expensive tea)

**Rumors & Hooks**
- A certification seal is being forged, and nobody wants to admit it.
- A boutique is selling “lucky” charms that keep appearing in disaster reports.
- A sponsor is quietly buying out rival inventories before the next [[Questings]].
