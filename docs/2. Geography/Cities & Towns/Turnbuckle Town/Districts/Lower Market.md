Lower Market is where Turnbuckle sells itself to the people who can’t afford the brochure version. The stalls are tight, the aisles are tighter, and everything smells like spice, sweat, and damp rope. If you need ten torches, a battered kettle, and a replacement boot in under five minutes, this is your district. If you need it to be guaranteed authentic, you should shop somewhere else.

This is also where the town’s energy is most real. Guides recruit here. Porters hustle here. Runners offer “shortcuts” here. Teams arrive from [[The Path to Adventure]] with their eyes wide and their pockets light, and the Market can tell within a minute who will last. The best vendors in Lower Market are kind in a way that feels sharp. They’ll help you find what you need, and they’ll remember what you didn’t know to ask.

Lower Market thrives on small margins and big volume. Anything from the docks can end up here in a day. Anything from the mines can end up here in an hour. If something is missing in another district, it sometimes appears in Lower Market under a slightly different name. 

**Landmarks**
- The rope-and-lantern corridor (always lit, even at noon)
- The whisper ring (a round of food stalls where rumors trade faster than coin)

**Rumors & Hooks**
- A stall has been cursed to attract thieves—and it’s working.
- A new supplier is undercutting prices and forcing old vendors out.
