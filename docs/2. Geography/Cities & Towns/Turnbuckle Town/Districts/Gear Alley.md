"Where steel gets its second chance."

**Known For:** smithies, repair bays, tool stalls, shouting, sparks, and last-minute upgrades  
**Vibe:** loud, practical, proud, and always slightly behind schedule

Gear Alley is a long scar of workshops and narrow storefronts where the air tastes like iron filings. Hammers talk all day, grinders sing all night, and the ground is permanently dusted with black grit. This is where adventurers go when their gear still works but their confidence doesn’t. If you walk in with a limp, nobody laughs. They just ask what broke.

Most businesses here survive on the rhythm of the [[Questings]] season. When a new cycle begins, Gear Alley swells like a lung—deliveries, apprentices, sponsors pretending to be humble. When the season ends, the Alley goes quiet in a way that feels like mourning. 

Gear Alley has rules that aren’t written down. Pay what you owe. Don’t touch someone else’s workbench. Don’t ask why a blade cracked clean down the middle unless you want the answer. In the back lanes, there are shops without signs where you can get a second set of “official” documents, a third set of keys, or a buckle that doesn’t show up on any inventory list.

**Landmarks**
- The open forge row (always crowded, always hot)
- The repair bays (wagons, armor, hinges, and anything that rolls)
- The alley shrines (tiny altars to luck, steel, and stubbornness)
