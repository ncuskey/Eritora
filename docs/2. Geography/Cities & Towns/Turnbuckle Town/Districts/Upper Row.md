"Soft beds and hard power."

**Known For:** fine lodging, guild offices, salons, sponsor meetings, quiet guards  
**Vibe:** elegant, careful, and dangerous in a polite way

Upper Row is the district of controlled access. The buildings are tall, the streets are clean, and the doors are guarded by people who don’t need to raise their voices. This is where deals happen. This is where reputations get repaired—or ruined.

Upper Row contains the kind of luxury that doesn’t show off. Inns here serve wine that tastes like money. Tailors here fix more than clothing. Offices here manage sponsors, contracts, and the public story of the town. If you want to hire a high-end guide, this is where you go. If you want to avoid being seen, you avoid this district entirely.

Upper Row has an atmosphere of certainty. Everyone is “busy.” Everyone is “connected.” Everyone is pretending they aren’t worried. But the district is built on fragile things: trust, influence, and the belief that control is real.

When something goes wrong in Turnbuckle, Upper Row is usually the last to admit it and the first to benefit from it.
