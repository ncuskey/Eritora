"Stone, sweat, and the part of the town that never stops working."

**Known For:** ore carts, work crews, taverns for laborers, soot, and blunt honesty  
**Vibe:** industrial, grounded, loud in the day, quieter at night

The Mines District is the reason Turnbuckle can afford to be Turnbuckle. It’s where the town’s glamour gets funded by hard labor and stubborn lungs. Ore carts rumble through the streets, and the buildings are built like they expect to be hit. People here don’t romanticize danger. They just measure it.

This district is full of working systems: schedules, whistles, shift changes, repair crews, and the kind of coordination that keeps people alive underground. Adventurers pass through looking for cheap metalwork, local hirelings, or a drink that doesn’t come with a speech. They’re tolerated, sometimes liked, and occasionally resented—especially when they talk about risk like it’s a game.

The Mines District has its own politics. Foremen and tool-masters carry real influence. The best smiths here don’t care about sponsor brands. They care about reliability. When something fails in a curated adventure, someone in the Mines District often hears about it first, because the failure smells like bad metal or rushed work.

If the town ever fractures between “show” and “real,” the Mines District will be the fault line.
