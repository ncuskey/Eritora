Lower Row is where people land when their luck runs out or their plan falls apart. It’s a district of narrow inns, shared rooms, and windows that don’t open all the way. The streets are calmer than Lower Market, but the calm here is the kind you don’t interrupt. People mind their business because they’ve learned what happens when you don’t.

Adventurers who fail their first run often drift here. So do the people who clean up after successful runs. Lower Row knows what the town pretends not to know: curated adventures may be controlled, but consequences still leak into real life. You see it in the limps, the bandages, the missing friends. You hear it in the late-night arguments spoken in whispers.

This district runs on informal systems: favors, shared meals, borrowed tools, and unofficial protection. If you’re polite, you can find almost anything. If you’re arrogant, you can lose almost everything. There are cheap healers here who will help you with no questions, and there are people who will ask the wrong questions on purpose.

Lower Row also has a quiet pride. It’s where people keep going. It’s where teams get rebuilt. It’s where a person can disappear into the crowd—or be found by someone who knows exactly where to look.
