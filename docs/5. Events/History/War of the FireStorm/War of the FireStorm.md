The War of the FireStorm (in Goblin lore known as [[The Burning of the World]]) was a goblin uprising and subsequent war. 

The war began in 1783 [[PCE]] when [[The Seven]] came together to make a plan to use the vast [[Arcanite]] resources around [[Turnbuckle Town]] to create a massive magical explosion. Historians and experts have estimated that if the [[Arcanite]] veins in the [[Amorpha Mountains]] had been ignited it would have certainly resulted in the destruction of [[Turnbuckle Town]] and [[New Turnbridge]] and would have had catastrophic effects as far away as the [[Salt Spill Islands]] to the South and to [[Gatherson's Hollow]] to the East. 

When the head of [[Turnbuckle Town]]'s city guard [[Valinthor the Great]] noticed increased Goblin activity he rounded up a coalition from nearby and began to fight. 

Army's sent to [[Amorpha Mountains]]. [[The Battle of Amorpha Pass]] was the final and most decisive battle of the war and took place at the top of the [[Amorpha Pass]].
