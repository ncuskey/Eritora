Curated Adventures or CAds for short are commercialized, pre-written and controlled adventures that allow adventurers from [[Eritora]] test their skills against real foes. While CAd business exist around the world the most famous, original, and best place to participate is in [[Turnbuckle Town]]. Here the three main CAd companies own land and host a wide variety of adventures. These companies are [[AD Venture]], [[Dungeon Disasters LLC]], and [[Goblin Games]]. 
CAds come in a wide variety of styles, difficulties and prices. Some can be accomplished in an afternoon for only 50gp/participant while others are epic multi-week or even month adventures that cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of gp. 

### Adventure Types
CAds are broken into nine genres which are as follows:

| Adventure Type  | Description                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Fetch]]       | Track down a specific object and bring it back—usually from somewhere inconvenient, guarded, or hard to reach.                        |
| [[3. Organizations/Businesses/Adventure Companies/CAd Types/Delivery]]    | Get something (or someone) safely from Point A to Point B while obstacles, pursuers, terrain, or time pressure complicate every mile. |
| [[Protect]]     | Hold the line: defend a person, place, convoy, or ritual long enough for it to survive what’s coming.                                 |
| [[Destroy]]     | Identify the target and eliminate it—an object, monster, structure, or system—before it can do more harm.                             |
| [[Investigate]] | Follow clues, interview witnesses, and connect patterns to reveal what’s really happening (and who benefits).                         |
| [[Negotiate]]   | Resolve a conflict through diplomacy, leverage, and careful wording—success depends on relationships as much as risks.                |
| [[Survival]]    | Endure an environment that doesn’t care if you live: scarce resources, hostile weather, relentless threats, and tough choices.        |
| [[Attain]]      | Earn or achieve a goal that can’t simply be taken—win a contest, secure a title, learn a secret, or prove you’re worthy.              |
| [[Combination]] | Two or more objectives collide (fetch + escape, negotiate + protect, investigate + destroy), forcing trade-offs and improvisation.    |

It is important to note that while CAds are curated, and often designed to work in the adventurers favor, they are dangerous and real and can result the the actual deaths of participants.
