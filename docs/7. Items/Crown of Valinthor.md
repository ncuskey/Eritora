*Unique Item, requires attunement*, *can only be attuned to by a winner of the [[questings]]*

The Crown of Valinthor is the crown worn by [[Valinthor the Great]] during [[War of the FireStorm]]. It appears as a delicate circlet forged from gleaming star-forged gold and inlaid with fine mithral runes. Its band is engraved with the names of past champions of the [[Questings]] in glowing script, and a centerpiece of finely cut [[Arcanite]] diamond glows with faint light whenever a new victor claims its power.

The Crown is sentient and can communicate with the wearer through the [[Telepathic Bond]] spell. The crown has an intelligence of 25 and, AC of 23 and 100HP. 

**Invoke a Champion.** The crown holds echoes of those whose names are inscribed within it. As a bonus action, you may invoke a champion’s name to gain one of the following benefits for 1 minute (choose when you invoke). Once you invoke a name, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
>Choose one:
> **The Scout:** You gain darkvision 120 ft. and can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 ft. of you and can see the outlines of shapes through walls less than 5 ft thick
> **The Sleuth:** You automatically detect illusions for what they are within 30 ft. (you still see the illusion, but you know it is false) and gain a advantage on stealth roles.
> **The Tactician:** You add your Intelligence modifier to initiative, and you can’t be surprised.

**The Foresight of Valinthor**: The crown grants you +2 on Intelligence to a maximum of 25, advantage on perception, insight and investigation checks. 

**Valinthor's Call**: Allies who can see you are immune to being frightened. 

**Future Seer**: Once per long rest, the crown will answer, to the best of its ability, any yes or no question about the future. 

**Goblin Foe**: The wearer does an additional 2d12 radiant damage to any [[Goblin]] species creature.

**Commanding Presence.** While you wear the crown, you gain proficiency in Persuasion. If you already have it, you gain expertise. Additionally, you may cast [[Command]] (save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

**[[Questings]] Champion**: The wearer is seen as a celebrity of vast wealth and prestige. Creatures capable of understanding authority instinctively sense your power and will try and curry favor with you if at all possible. Disguises and deception checks automatically fail against creatures who have seen you wear the Crown. You are granted expertise on Intimidation checks. 

**Claim the Crown.** When you complete a major Trial (DM-defined milestone: defeating a boss, solving a world-level mystery, winning a public finale), the gem flares and you may add permanent hit points equal to the roll of one of your hit dice. Additionally, choose one Crown Boon that lasts until the next long rest:
- gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws to all allies within 30 ft, or
- gain 10 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns while in combat (ends if you are incapacitated), or
- your weapon attacks deal +4d6 radiant damage.
