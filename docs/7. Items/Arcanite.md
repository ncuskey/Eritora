Arcanite is a rare mineral that can be used to add or enhance magical powers within many items. Pure arcanite glows a faint blue, red, purple or green hue depending on its geologic and arcane creation. 

Arcanite deposits are relatively rare and dangerous to mine as its untapped magical energy can lead to unforeseen and incredible harmful consequences. However, due to its value and market price, arcanite is mined all around [[Eritora]]. The largest veins of arcanite have been found in the [[Amorpha Mountains]] and on some of the [[Salt Spill Islands]]. 

Raw arcanite is generally considered dangerous and unstable. This is why it was a perfect target for [[Goblin|Goblins]] during the [[War of the FireStorm]]. Only expert and licensed [[Artificer|Artificers]] can take the raw material and turn it into something anyone can use to imbue items with magical properties. While raw arcanite is expensive, milled arcanite is nearly priceless. 

See [[The Arcane Forge]] for rules on crafting.
