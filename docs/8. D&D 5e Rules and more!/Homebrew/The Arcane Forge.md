> "Old stories tell of a great forge beneath the Salt Spill Islands. Stories of artifacts forged in the heat of the very earth. But I know more than old stories. I've seen the forge. I know what can be made there. And if you bring me to it... I'll show you."
> 
> - Brogan, Blacksmith of Utopia

There's a great deal of debate as to what makes a forge an arcane forge. Is it the material it is made of, or the place where it is built? The magic woven into it by its maker? Whatever the answer may be, all that truly matters is this: given time, coin, and the skill to use it, there is no limit to the marvels that you could create at such a forge.

## Crafting Magic Items
To create other magic items other than spell scrolls and potions, follow the rules below. In these rules, “you” refers to the character crafting the magic items.

###### Arcana Proficiency
To craft a magic item, you must have proficiency in Arcana.

###### Tools
The **Magic Item Tools** table lists which tool is required to make a magic item of each category. You or one of your assistants must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. For more information on the tools, see _Equipment._

| Item Category | Required Tool                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Potion        | Alchemist’s Supplies or Herbalism Kit                                                                                           |
| Ring          | Jeweler’s Tools                                                                                                                 |
| Rod           | Woodcarver’s Tools                                                                                                              |
| Scroll        | Calligrapher’s Supplies                                                                                                         |
| Staff         | Woodcarver’s Tools                                                                                                              |
| Wand          | Woodcarver’s Tools                                                                                                              |
| Weapon        | Leatherworker’s Tools, Smith’s Tools, or Woodcarver’s Tools depending on the kind of weapon as noted in the tools’ descriptions |
| Wondrous Item | Tinker’s Tools or the tool required to make the nonmagical item on which the magic item is based (if any)                       |

###### Spells
If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.

###### Time and Cost
Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the **Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost** table.

- **Work per Day.** For each day of crafting, you must work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days, those days needn’t be consecutive.
- **Assistants.** Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants. Any assistants must have proficiency with the tool required to make the item they are assisting in the creation of.

| Item Rarity | Time*    | Cost       |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Common      | 5 days   | 50 GP      |
| Uncommon    | 10 days  | 200 GP     |
| Rare        | 50 days  | 2,000 GP   |
| Very Rare   | 125 days | 20,000 GP  |
| Legendary   | 250 days | 100,000 GP |
### Raw Materials
To craft a magic item, you require rare crafting materials that may be difficult to find. If you're lucky enough to find yourself in a place that sells such items, they can be bought at the prices listed in the table above. If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item first.

The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than a *Spell Scrolls and *Potions of Healing.

The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available. Alternatively, the GM can roll 1d100 and consult the material availability table to determine available materials for each magic item being crafted.

| Settlement Size | Uncommon | Rare | Very Rare | Legendary |
| --------------- | -------- | ---- | --------- | --------- |
| Village         | 50%      | 35%  | 25%       | 15%       |
| Town            | 80%      | 70%  | 60%       | 50%       |
| City            | 90%      | 90%  | 80%       | 70%       |
| Metropolis      | 99%      | 95%  | 95%       | 90%       |

#### Essence
The creation of a magic item can be aided by having an essence appropriate to that item. An essence is a component, usually recovered from a monster, that can be used to aid in the creation of specific magic items, as determined by the GM. If you have an essence, you can spend it while creating the associated magic item to halve the cost of raw materials required to make the item. Additionally, once an essence has been spent on a magic item's creation, any remaining raw materials should be considered mundane enough to be available at most reasonably stocked stores.

Since there are countless magic items, there's no definitive list of what essences correspond to what magic items, but you can use the following rules as a framework for finding and using essences in play.

###### Essence as Loot
>Among the noxious fumes and foul reagents on the shelves, Octavia finds a jar full of petrified spider legs. With her arcana, she is able to determine that they could be used as an essence to create *Slippers of Spider Climbing*.

In this example, the GM gave the player character an essence: a jar full of petrified spider legs, and, after an arcana check from the player, suggested what kind of magic item that could be used to create. But it doesn't have to end there: the player might follow up and ask if they could instead use it for something like a *Cloak of Arachnida.* It'll be up to the GM to decide if that's okay or not. In this case, since the cloak is a much higher rarity than the slippers, and the players might still be fairly low level, the GM might decide that's too much. Alternatively, the resources required for such an expensive crafting project might seem an exciting side quest.

###### Essence as a Goal
> "I'm in my tower studying how to craft a *Carpet of Flying*," says Anna.
> "Other than having a carpet to enchant, and the gems and herbs you'll need, you think you'll need the essence of some creature that has a fly speed and can hover," replies the GM, setting a goal for her to achieve.

In this example, the player wanted to make a specific item, and the GM offered a path towards it. If Octavia can either find or harvest the essence from an appropriate creature, she now knows that would aid her in making a *Carpet of Flying*.

###### Harvesting Essence from Monsters
When players defeat a monster in battle, they may be able to harvest an essence from it. They do this by a combination of actions:

***Study the Creature.*** You can use the [[Study]] action to attempt to identify an essence that could be extracted from a creature. Make an arcana check with a DC of 10 + the creature's CR. On a success, you learn what part of the creature would have to be harvested to gain that essence.

***Harvest the Essence.*** You can use the [[Utilize]] action to attempt to harvest a specific essence from a creature that died within the last round. Make a survival check with a DC of 10 + the creature's CR. On a success, you harvest that essence. On a failure, the essence is destroyed. 

As the GM it's up to you to take a look at the creature's monster statblock and determine what useful parts there are and describe the player's success or failure. Alternatively, you can ask your table to contribute any ideas.

For example, Ankhegs have Acid Spray. Altan the Wizard makes a successful arcana check, identifying that these glands could be used as an essence in the creation of a *Potion of Resistance* or *Armor of Acid Resistance.* When the Ankheg dies, he calls out to Maeve the Ranger, telling her to cut out it's acid glands.

You can also use a creature's CR as a guideline in determining what rarity of magic items and essence from that creature could be used to create.

| CR           | Rarity    |
| ------------ | --------- |
| 1 or higher  | Uncommon  |
| 5 or higher  | Rare      |
| 10 or higher | Very Rare |
| 15 or higher | Legendary |  

## Crafting Weapons & Armor
> "Humans hold such pride in the might of their armies. But the mightiest host of men could not hope to defeat even a single one of our warriors wielding a sword of the purest mithral, worked to perfection by hands of our enchanters." 
> 
> - Virsandroal, Master of the Order of Insight

The right weapon or armor can elevate a character's abilities far beyond anything they could achieve without them. And when you're the one crafting the item, making sure it's the right one is entirely up to you.

### Enchanting Magic Items
As part of the creation of a magic item, you may choose to imbue it with an enchantment. Any weapon or armor can be enchanted, but doing so bears a considerable time and gold investment. Enchanting a magic item follows the same time and cost rules as laid out in the Crafting Magic Items chapter at the beginning of this document. Refer to the tables below for the rarity of each enchantment.

#### Enchantment Limitations
Magic items with multiple enchantments have the following limitations: 

###### Three Enchantments
No magic item can hold more than three enchantments. When you put a fourth enchantment on an item, you must chose which other enchantment you're removing from the item.

###### No Stacking
You cannot put the multiple instances of the same enchantment on an item.

###### Attunement
If any property of a magic item requires attunement, then the item as a whole requires attunement. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise.

When you enchant ammunition, it doesn't require attunement even if the enchantment normally requires attunement.

  

### Universal Enchantments
You can add the following enchantments on anything, be it an existing wondrous item, magic weapon, magic armor, or a mundane item.

When you damage a creature with this weapon, it takes 1d4 additional psychic damage and subtracts that amount from the next d20 test it makes before the end of its next turn.

###### Dancing
You can take a bonus action to toss this magic weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of itself. The weapon uses your attack roll and adds your ability modifier to damage rolls.

While the weapon hovers, you can take a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the weapon to attack one creature within 5 feet of the weapon.

After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to the ground in your space. If the weapon has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or are more than 30 feet away from it.

###### Dueling
When you hit a creature with this weapon, it must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to fight you until the end of its next turn. While compelled, this creature has disadvantage on attacking creatures other than you while you are within 5 feet of it, and it cannot willingly move further away from you. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

###### Explosive
When you kill a creature with an attack using this weapon, roll the weapon's damage dice again. Creatures within 5 feet of the killed creature take damage equal to the result. 

###### Flame Tongue
You can use a bonus action to wreathe this weapon in flames. While wreathed in flames the weapon deals an extra 2d6 fire damage on a hit and sheds [[Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet.

###### Frost Brand
This weapon deals an extra 1d6 cold damage. You gain resistance to fire damage while you are attuned to it, and while in freezing temperatures the weapon sheds [[Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet.

When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of yourself. Once used, this property can’t be used again for 1 hour.

###### Holy Avenger
When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this weapon it takes 2d10 radiant damage. While you hold the drawn weapon, it creates a 10-foot [[Emanation]] originating from you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the emanation have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

###### Life Stealing
When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, that target takes an extra 15 necrotic damage if it isn’t a construct or an undead, and you gain [[Temporary Hit Points]] equal to the amount of necrotic damage taken.

###### Maddening
When you hit a creature with this weapon, it must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk until the end of its next turn. While berserk, the target attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the target attacks an object. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

###### Marking
When you hit a creature with this weapon you mark it as your prey. For the next 24 hours, you know the distance and direction to your prey so long as it remains on the same plane of existence.

###### Mighty Cleaving
If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against another creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage. You cannot attack the same creature more than once with this property as a part of the same attack.

###### Mind Breaker
When you hit a creature with this weapon it takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on the next Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

###### Oathsworn
When you use this weapon to make an attack, you can utter or sign the following command words: “Swift death to you who have wronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn. While you have a sworn enemy, the following properties apply:

_**Attacks Affected.**_ You have advantage on your sworn enemy, and disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.

_**No Cover.**_ Your sworn enemy gains no benefit from [[Cover]]. If you're making a ranged attack, you suffer no disadvantage due to long range.

_**Extra Damage.**_ Your sworn enemy an extra 3d6 damage from all attacks made with this weapon.

###### Parrying
When you're hit with an attack, you can use your reaction to increase your AC against that attack by a number equal to your proficiency bonus. If this turns the attack into a miss, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against the creature that attacked you as a part of the same attack.

###### Primordial
This weapon is imbued with the power of the outer planes. When you create this weapon choose a type of damage from the table, or roll randomly. The weapon deals an extra 1d8 damage of that type.

###### Ruin
This weapon deals an extra 2d8 lightning damage. While attuned to this weapon, you are immune to being charmed or frightened.

###### Sharpness
When you attack an object with this weapon and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target. When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 Slashing damage and gains 1 [[Exhaustion]] level.

###### Skin Melter
When you hit a creature with this weapon it takes an extra 1d10 acid damage and is [[Frightened]] of you until the end of its next turn.

###### Slaying
When creating a slaying weapon you determine what creature type it's designed to slay, or roll randomly on the creature type table. Slaying enchantments are different depending on if they're for ammunition or a weapon.

_**Ammunition.**_ If a creature of the chosen damage type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one. After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.

###### Swatting
When creating a swatting weapon you determine what creature type it's designed to swat, or roll randomly on the creature type table. When you hit a creature of the chosen creature type it takes an extra 2d6 damage. If that creature is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer by this damage, it dies.

###### Thunderbolt
When you hit a creature with this weapon it takes an extra 2d8 thunder damage, and you can choose to take a bonus action to have the weapon emit a thunderous boom. If you do, the target and every creature within 30 feet of it other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[Stunned]] until the end of your next turn. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

###### Throwing
The weapon has the [[02) Weapons#Properties|Thrown property]] with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.

###### Transforming
You can use a bonus action to change the shape and statistics of this weapon into those of any other weapon that belongs to the same category (i.e. a simple weapon can only become another simple weapon, and a martial weapon can only become another martial weapon).

###### Venom
You can take a bonus action to magically coat this weapon with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and be [[Poisoned]] for 1 minute. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

###### Vicious
This magic weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage to any creature it hits. This extra damage is of the same type as the weapon’s normal damage.

###### Vorpal
When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, you cut off or destroy one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it has immunity to the weapon's damage, if it doesn’t have or need a head, or if the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 30 damage of the weapon's damage type from the hit. If the creature has Legendary Resistance, it can expend one daily use of that trait to avoid losing its head, taking the extra damage instead.

###### Warning
As long as this weapon is within your reach and you are attuned to it, you and allies within 30 feet of you gain the following benefits.

**_Alarm._** The weapon magically awakens each subject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. This benefit doesn’t wake a subject from magically induced sleep.

**_Supernatural Readiness._** Each subject has advantage on its initiative rolls.

###### Withering
When you hit a creature with this weapon it takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage and has disadvantage on the next Strength, Dexterity or Constitution saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

###### Wounding
When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to regain hit points for 1 hour. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Rare Metal Forging
The first step in creating a magic weapon or armor is determining the material it's made of. There are many types of rare metals, each of which confers powerful benefits to the item it's used to create.

Crafting an item out of a rare metal, the cost and time required is determined by adding together the cost and time of the mundane item you're making and the rarity of the magic metal by consulting the Time and Cost table above. Consult the Rare Metal table below to determine the rarity. Alternatively, the GM can roll on the table to randomly determine an item's material.

| 2d8  | Rare Metal  | Cost per Ingot | Rarity    |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------      | --------- |
| 2    | Vertsteel   | 10.000 gp      | Legendary |
| 3    | Imixium     | 5.000 gp       | Very Rare |
| 4    | Adamantine  | 2.500 gp       | Very Rare |
| 5    | Cold Iron   | 1.000 gp       | Rare      |
| 6    | Whiteforged | 500 gp         | Rare      |
| 7    | Silver      | 100 gp         | Uncommon  |
| 8-10 | Masterwork  | N/A            | Common    |
| 11   | Orichalcum  | 100 gp         | Uncommon  |
| 12   | Blacksteel  | 500 gp         | Rare      |
| 13   | Zarinthic   | 1.000 gp       | Rare      |
| 14   | Mithral     | 2.500 gp       | Very Rare |
| 15   | Bloodmetal  | 5.000 gp       | Very Rare |
| 16   | Sunmetal    | 10.000 gp      | Legendary |

#### Rare Metal Ingots
To create weapons or armor from rare metal, you need ingots of that metal. The cost and rarity of each type of ingot are listed on the table above, and the number of ingots required is listed below.

| Item Being Crafted        | Ingots Required |
| ------------------------  | --------------- |
| Light Weapon              | 1               |
| Weapon or Light Armor     | 2               |
| Heavy Weapon or Shield    | 3               |
| Medium Armor              | 4               |
| Heavy Armor (except Plate)| 5               |
| Plate Armor               | 6               |

As a rule of thumb, rare metal ingots are at their best when they're treated as rewards to be discovered rather than as materials to be purchased. The party could find stacks of adamantine in a dwarven ruin, or a single bar of mithral preserved in an old elvish vault. In this case, the cost of the ingot listed above is irrelevant.

###### Finding an Arcane Forge
To create weapons or armor out of rare metals, you must be working the metal at an arcane forge. Where you can find such a forge is up to the GM. Perhaps it's found in a vast metropolis where magic items are more common, and access to the forge carefully controlled. Or maybe it's deep within a dungeon where it lies dormant, waiting to be rediscovered and for its flames to be kindled once more.

Wherever it may be found, getting access to an arcane forge can be an excellent reward for players around level 5, especially in a game where crafting and downtime are a major factor.

#### Rare Metal Alloy
When creating a new magic weapon or armor with a rare metal, you can attempt to combine the two metals into a powerful alloy. When you do the you use the more powerful Magic Weapon or Magic Armor property and add all the properties of both metals on the weapon.

## Finalizing a Weapon
When you've crafted the item and enchanted it, all that's left to do is some finalization.

#### Determine Rarity
The rarity of the completed item is equal to the rarity of the rarest metal, enchantment, or spellcasting property on the item. Every enchantment or inclusion of a spellcasting property increases the rarity by one step. For example, a Masterwork Longsword is Uncommon Item, but once you've added the Maneuvering Enchantment it becomes a Rare item, if you then later reenchant the weapon to include the Vorpal enchantment, it's now a legendary weapon.

The completed item's rarity doesn't affect the time and cost required to make the item.

#### Determine Attunement
If any part of your magic item requires attunement, the item as a whole requires attunement.

#### Name the Item
No magic item is complete without a name, and there are a few ways to give it a memorable name.

###### Using the Listed Names
You can simply use the listed enchantments as inspiration. An Adamantine Longsword with the Mighty Cleaving enchantment might be the Adamantine Sword of Mighty Cleaving, whereas a Mithral Longsword with the Luck enchantment might be the Lucky Mithral Longsword.

###### Creating Evocative Names
You can chose to give your weapon a name evocative of your character or of the weapon's properties without naming them explicitly. Names like Slayer or Skewer, or Lady come to mind. Or maybe your character names it after someone they love, and their Bloodmetal Vorpal Greatsword could be called Rosie.

###### Bit of Both
You could also find the fun within between evocative names and listed names. A greatsword with the Swatting enchantment that is honed in on the humanoid creature type might be mostly used for killing goblins. And thus: you've got a Greatsword of Goblinswatting.

### Example Marvels
Below are listed some example magic items.

#### Greatsword of Goblinswatting
*Greatsword, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This adamantine greatsword was created by Squaker the Dwarf to destroy goblinoids, but it has since found use in killing all kinds of humanoid invaders.

###### Adamantine Weapon
***Magic Weapon.*** You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

***Adamantine.*** This weapon deals force damage to constructs, elementals and objects instead of its regular damage type.

***Reliable.*** When you hit a creature with an attack using an adamantine weapon, you may reroll the weapon's damage dice and use the higher roll.

###### Mighty Cleaving
If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against another creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage. You cannot attack the same creature more than once with this property as a part of the same attack.

###### Humanoid Swatting
When you hit a humanoid creature with this weapon it takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type. If that creature is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer by this damage, it dies.

#### Allerophon's Spartanium Armor
*Plate Armor, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

When Sparta used her Spark of Creation to make weapons for the Chosen to kill the God of Time, she forged them from a combination of metals; both Adamantine and Orichalcum.

###### Primordial
This weapon deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage.

###### Striking
