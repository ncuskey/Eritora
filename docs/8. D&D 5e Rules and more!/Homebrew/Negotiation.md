*Based on Matt Colville's Draw Steel negotiation mechanic* 

This mechanic is designed for **High Stakes Negotiations**, not as a rule for every NPC interaction. Specifically, the time to use these rules is during:
- A high stakes conversation
- When the party has a plausible request (i.e. asking the king to send an army to fight the goblins in the North, not kill yourself and give me your money.) *Have the players write their request down!*
- The NPC wants to negotiate
- NPC has a reason to not just say "yes".

 >[!important]
 >This is not designed to replace standard role play. Use Persuasion, Insight, Intimidation and Deception checks if the role playing criteria above are not met.

 >*"Negotiation is not a process that changes an NPC's character. Rather the Heros are trying to make an NPC understand how behaving differently would actually be in character."* - Matt Colville in *Draw Steel*

The negotiation mechanic uses four main stats to determine how willing a NPC is to negotiate: **[[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]]**, **[[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]]**, **[[Negotiation#Motivations|Motivations]]** and **[[Negotiation#Pitfalls|Pitfalls]]**. 

### Negotiation Steps
1. Determine NPC's [[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]] and [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] scores based on [[Negotiation#Attitude|Attitude]] toward players.
2. Determine NPC's [[Negotiation#Motivations|Motivations]] and [[Negotiation#Pitfalls|Pitfalls]]. 
3. Run the [[Negotiation#Running the Negotiation Scene|Negotiation Scene]]!

### Player Actions and Consequences in the Negotiation Scene
Players can make four checks during a negotiation:
- Persuasion checks
- Insight checks (if attempting to read NPC)
- Intimidation checks
- Deception checks (if lying)

And each check will fall into one of three bands of results:
- 11 or lower = failure
- 12 to 16 = partial failure or partial success
- 17 or higher = success

#### Player Actions
Players have three actions they can take on their turn:
 1. Get a read on an NPC
	 - Make an Insight check
		 - Failure: The NPC realizes the party is trying to get a read on them. [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] is reduced by 1. 
		 - DC 12 Partial Failure: The NPC is hard to read!
		 - DC 17 Success: The player learns one of the NPC's [[Negotiation#Motivations|Motivations]] or [[Negotiation#Pitfalls|Pitfalls]]. 
 2. Make an argument
	 - DM Determines: Is the party appealing to the NPC's [[Negotiation#Motivations|Motivation]], [[Negotiation#Pitfalls|Pitfall]], neither or lying?
		 - Appeal to a [[Negotiation#Motivations|Motivation]]: Make a Persuasion or Intimidation check.
			 - Failure: [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] is reduced by 1. 
			 - DC 12 Partial Success: [[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]] increases by 1. [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] decreases by 1. 
			 - DC 17 Success: [[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]] increases by 1.
		 - Appeal to a [[Negotiation#Pitfalls|Pitfalls]]: Automatic failure.
			 -  [[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]] decreases by 1. [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] decreases by 1. 
		 - Appeal to Neither: Make a Persuasion or Intimidation check.
			 - Failure: [[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]] decreases by 1. [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] decreases by 1. 
			 - DC 12 Partial Failure: [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] decreases by 1. 
			 - DC 17 Success: [[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]] increases by 1. [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] decreases by 1. 
		 - Telling a Lie: Make a standard Deception check. 
			 - Standard consequences of appealing to [[Negotiation#Motivations|Motivations]], [[Negotiation#Pitfalls|Pitfalls]] or neither.
			 - Getting caught in the lie decreases [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] by 1. 
 3. Accept an offer
	 - NPC makes an offer, determined by their current [[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]] level on the [[Negotiation#Outcomes|outcomes table]]. This is a final offer but the players aren't required to accept it. 

### NPC Willingness to Negotiate
Some NPC's might be keen to hear what the players have to say. Some may not. We can determine these factors for each NPC using [[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]] and [[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]] scores. Each of these scores is determined by a NPC's [[Negotiation#Attitude|Attitude]] towards the players in that moment. 

#### Interest
An NPC's interest represents how eager they are to make a deal with the PCs. Interest is graded on a scale of 1 (no interest) to 6 (highly interested). At the beginning of negotiation a NPC's interest starts between 2 and 5. If the NPC's interest ever goes to 6, they make a final offer and the negotiation ends. If the NPC's interest ever drops to 1 they end the negotiation without offering the players anything. Interest can increase and decrease during the negotiation. The interest score of the NPC at the end of the negotiation determines what type of offer the NPC makes to the players. 

#### Patience
An NPC's patience represents how much time and effort they are willing to devote to negotiation. Patience is graded on a scale of 1 (no patience) to 6 (very patient). Each NPC must start a negotiation with a patience score higher than 1. If the NPC's patience score ever reaches 1 they make the players a final offer and the negotiation ends. Patience can decrease each time the players make an argument. 

#### Attitude
When entering a negotiation the DM must determine the NPC's attitude towards the players. Use the table below to determine the **[[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]]** and **[[Negotiation#Patience|Patience]]** scores based on attitude towards players. 

| Attitude   | Int. | Pat. |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- |
| Hostile    | 2    | 3    |
| Suspicious | 3    | 3    |
| Neutral    | 3    | 4    |
| Open       | 4    | 4    |
| Friendly   | 4    | 5    |
| Trusting   | 5    | 5    |
### Types of Arguments
The DM will also have to determine what types of arguments will and will not work given the NPC's character traits. To determine these we will use the mechanic of **[[Negotiation#Motivations|Motivations]]** and **[[Negotiation#Pitfalls|Pitfalls]]**. A good starting point is to give the NPC three motivations and two pitfalls.

#### Motivations
A motivation is a core belief the NPC holds. When players appeal to these beliefs they can expect better results. 

#### Pitfalls
Pitfalls are values which the NPC does not identify with and would be insulted to be associated with. Arguments mentioning pitfalls always fail.

##### Motivations and Pitfalls Table
Below is a table of motivations and pitfalls from *Draw Steel* but the DM is free to create their own if none of these fit their NPC well. Remember, one characters motivation can be another's pitfall!

### Outcomes
When a negotiation ends use the table below to determine, based on the NPC's **[[Negotiation#Interest|Interest]]** at the end of the negotiation, the outcome for the players. Make sure to refer back to and to take into account the players original request when determining an outcome.

| Interest | Outcome                   |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| 1        | No, and something bad...  |
| 2        | No.                       |
