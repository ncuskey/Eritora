## Overview
Quantity over quality is the name of the game at Beast Bargain. [[Greema Grawlins]] worked for years in the [[Eritora National Government]] as head of the [[Monster Management Committee]]. After leaving they used their connects to build a massive supply chain of monsters around the country. With over 400 personnel in their employ Beast Bargain is by far the largest MAC in [[Eritora]].
