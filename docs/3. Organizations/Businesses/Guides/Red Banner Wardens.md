Red Banner Wardens are the protective, practical middle lane: not glamorous, not cheap, and rarely wrong. They specialize in keeping clients alive through chaos—especially teams who keep picking fights inside “controlled environments.”

Jorun runs it like a small army, which is either comforting or insulting depending on the client.
