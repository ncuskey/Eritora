In [[Turnbuckle Town]], a guide is part scout, part instructor, part insurance policy, and part reputation shield. Some guides are sponsor-friendly professionals. Some are desperate locals with good instincts. Some are a problem you hire on purpose.

Most guide rates are priced **per day** for a single [[CAd]] / curated adventure run unless stated otherwise.

## Directory
- [[Gilded Compass]] — high-end, sponsor-safe, immaculate planning
- [[Red Banner Wardens]] — disciplined protection, practical exits, team control
- [[Lanternline Wayfinders]] — river routes, fog navigation, quiet logistics on [[The Dewmist River]]
- [[Cobbleknife Escorts]] — cheap, fast, sketchy, and strangely effective

## How Hiring Works (Quick Notes)
- **Deposits:** Most reputable outfits ask **25–50% upfront** (non-refundable if you ignore instructions).
- **Scope:** A “guide” usually means **navigation + decision support**, not doing the dungeon for you.
- **Add-ons:** Porters, extra guards, and paperwork handling are common upsells.
- **Reputation:** Teams who burn guides get quietly blacklisted across multiple services.

## Typical Price Bands
| Tier | Typical Rate | What You’re Buying |
|---|---:|---|
| Low-end / sketchy | 5–15 gp/day | Speed, rumors, shortcuts, risk you don’t see |
| Professional | 25–75 gp/day | Reliability, safety habits, clean retreat plans |
| Elite | 100–250 gp/day | High-level problem solving, prestige, limited availability |

## Complications (d6)
Roll when a party hires a guide, argues with a guide, or when a run “should be safe.”

1. **Paperwork Snag:** A permit/waiver is “missing” and someone suggests a fee to “find it.” (See [[Ink & Iron Registry]].)
2. **Rival Team:** Another team hired the same guide for overlapping hours and refuses to yield.
3. **Sponsor Demand:** A sponsor requests a “hero moment” that increases risk, and the guide resents being directed.
4. **Route Is Wrong:** A map shows a passage that doesn’t exist, or an entrance that leads somewhere it shouldn’t. (See [[The Cartographer's Corner]].)
5. **The Fog Answers:** Lantern codes or whistles get a response from the wrong direction. (See [[Dewmist Lantern Ferries]].)
6. **The Guide Knows You:** The guide recognizes a PC from a past run (or a rumor) and adjusts their behavior accordingly.

## Quick Hooks (d6)
1. A guide offers a discount if the party retrieves a lost signet/contract before morning.
2. A client the guide escorted yesterday never returned, but their gear did.
3. The guide insists on a detour to avoid “a corridor that remembers faces.”
4. A guide is being tailed—quietly—and wants the party to notice.
5. The party is asked to guide the guide: someone threatens their family unless they sabotage a run.
6. A “new guide” is too good. No one knows where they came from.
