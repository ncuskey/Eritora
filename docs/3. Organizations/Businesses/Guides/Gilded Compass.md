**Owner:** [[Ser Caldra Vane]]

The Gilded Compass Guild is the polished face of professional guiding in [[Turnbuckle Town]]. Their clients are usually sponsored teams, wealthy first-timers, or returning victors who want certainty more than bravado. They bring maps, contingency plans, and calming words that sound like contracts.

Most locals assume the Guild has quiet ties to [[AD Venture]]. Caldra denies it with a smile that never quite reaches her eyes.
