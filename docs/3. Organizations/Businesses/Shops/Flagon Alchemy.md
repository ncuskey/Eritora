Flagon Alchemy is a narrow shop with thick glass windows and shelves that glow softly in the dim. The air smells like citrus peel, bitter herbs, and burnt sugar. Adventurers come here when they need something that works now, not something that tastes good.

[[Veyra Flint]] runs the counter with stained fingers and a smile that suggests she has seen every mistake a person can make. [[Hern Doss]] is the head tester and proudly claims he has “only died twice” in the last year. A runner named [[Rin Wicket]] can deliver a potion across town faster than most people can finish a sentence.

A rumor says Veyra has a private contract with one of the [[CAd]] companies to supply “controlled failures” for dramatic effect. She calls it nonsense. Hern refuses to drink anything labeled *For Demonstration Only*.
