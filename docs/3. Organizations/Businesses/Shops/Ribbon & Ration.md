"Pack light. Live longer."

**Owner:** [[Marta Vale]]
**Location:** [[Market Row]], [[Turnbuckle Town]]
**Number in Employ:** 9 staff, 2 stitchers, 1 artificer-on-retainer
**Known For:** "Clean Crawl" kits and rope that never frays (until it does)

Ribbon & Rations is half outfitter and half showroom. Everything is organized like it matters: rope coils hung like jewelry, rations labeled by region, gloves sorted by grip. People come here before their first curated adventure, and they come here again after they learn what a "controlled environment" actually feels like.

[[Marta Vale]] runs the shop with a soft voice and a sharp eye. She prices gear by looking at your hands and your posture, and she can tell when someone is about to lie about their level. [[Durn Bragg]] is the stock clerk and retired trap-tester; he gives advice that nobody asks for and he is usually right. In the back, [[Iolo "Ink" Siff]] paints heraldry onto shields and helmets for teams who want their brand to look official.
