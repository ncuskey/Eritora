Cartographer’s Corner is where hopeful teams go to feel prepared. The walls are layered with maps—valleys, rivers, city alleys, and stylized dungeon layouts that look clean enough to be propaganda. There is always ink drying somewhere.

[[Teln Cartwright]] sells maps with a steady smile and never promises accuracy without charging for it. [[Pera Finch]] is a surveyor who returns muddy and quiet. A runner called [[Ollin Thread]] delivers sealed map tubes to sponsors and never opens them.
