"Hooves, wheels, and the truth about your tack."

**Owner:** [[Orin Hinge]]
**Location:** Between the South Gate Coach Yard and Market Row, [[Turnbuckle Town]]
**Number in Employ:** 7 stablehands, 3 wheelwrights, 2 farriers
**Known For:** Fast repairs, calm horses, and discreet storage

Hinge & Harness is where broken travel becomes usable travel again. Their stable smells like hay and hot iron, and the back wall is lined with harnesses labeled with names that don’t match the people wearing them.

[[Orin Hinge]] is gentle with animals and impatient with customers. [[Petra Latch]] runs wheel repair and can reset a bent axle faster than most folks can complain. A quiet boy called [[Kellan Brine]] sleeps in the loft and claims he “hears” when a horse has been spooked by magic.

Orin offers a service called "overnight quiet"—for double price, your carriage and animals are moved to a back stall no one can see from the street. People say sponsors use it. People also say smugglers do.
