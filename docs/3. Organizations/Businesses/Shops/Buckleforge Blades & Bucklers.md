**Known For:** Custom weapon balancing and shield straps that never slip

Buckleforge is all sound—hammers, grinders, and the steady hiss of quenched steel. The shop is famous for fitting weapons to people instead of people to weapons. Adventurers come in with bruised wrists and leave with different habits.

[[Master Juno Buckleforge]] has the patience of a teacher and the temper of a furnace. [[Kerris Slate]] measures grip and stance like a priest measures sin. The apprentice, [[Toma Ash]], is young, eager, and keeps a secret collection of broken blades that “failed” in curated adventures.
