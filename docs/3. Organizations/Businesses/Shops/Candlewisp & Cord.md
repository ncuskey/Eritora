"If it holds, it counts."

**Owner:** [[Nessa Candlewisp]]
**Location:** Lower Market, [[Turnbuckle Town]]
**Number in Employ:** 5 riggers, 4 chandlers, 2 climbers, 1 bookkeeper
**Known For:** Glowcord rope and lanterns built for fog, smoke, and panic

Candlewisp & Cord sells the small things that keep people alive when the big things fail. Rope, hooks, oil, chalk, and lanterns with shutters you can close with one hand. The shop is tidy, but it always smells like wax and old stone.

[[Nessa Candlewisp]] is calm and direct. [[Roan Tether]] is the rigger who tests every knot in public and judges people quietly. The bookkeeper, [[Mira Lilt]], writes everything down in a ledger that looks too clean to be honest.

Nessa offers a service called “Quiet Rigging”—she will set up a team’s gear in advance and label it for fast grabs. It costs extra, and she only offers it to people she trusts.
