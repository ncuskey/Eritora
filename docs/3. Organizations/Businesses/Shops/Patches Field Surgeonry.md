Patches Field Surgeonry sits close to where people stumble into town. The front room is bright and clean. The back room is quieter and smells like sharp alcohol and crushed leaves. Adventurers arrive here proud and leave humbled, usually with new bandages and fewer opinions.

[[Sister Halden Patch]] is kind in a way that does not invite argument. [[Bram Wisp]], the herbalist, grows plants in jars and claims each one has a temperament. The cleaner, [[Gads Lorn]], says nothing and sees everything.

Halden keeps a locked cabinet of supplies marked *FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY*. Some nights the lock is warm, as if recently touched. Bram says the town has more emergencies than it admits.
