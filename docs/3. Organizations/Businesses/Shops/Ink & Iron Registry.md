Ink & Irons is the quiet throat of Turnbuckle's adventure economy. If you want a team name recognized, a contract enforceable, or a sponsor unable to wriggle out of payment, you come here. The hall smells like wax and iron shavings, and every desk has a small bell that makes a sound like a verdict.

[[Quillmaster Perran Soot]] speaks softly and stamps loudly. [[Jessa Wint]] is a junior notary who still believes rules can protect people, which makes her dangerous in this town. The Registry also keeps [[Brother Hollow]], an ink-servitor that never blinks and never forgets a signature once it has tasted it.
