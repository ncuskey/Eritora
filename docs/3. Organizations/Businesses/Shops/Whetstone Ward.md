Whetstone Ward is part shop, part shrine. The walls are covered with runic strips and warning labels, and the counter is lined with stones that hum faintly when you touch them. Adventurers come here when they’re tired of losing gear to damp corridors and cheap curses.

[[Erem Whetstone]] speaks like a person reading from a rulebook he wrote himself. [[Sana Wardell]] is a rune-scribe who smiles when customers get nervous. A quiet watcher called [[Brill]] stands near the door and does not introduce himself.

A small sign by the register reads: *We do not ward items used in [[Goblin Games]] events.* Erem says it’s a moral stance. Sana says it’s liability. Brill says nothing at all.
