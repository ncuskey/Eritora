Brassleaf Curios & Repairs looks like a shop that should be closed—half the lights are always out and there is always a project on the floor. Inside, it is a den of delicate work: cracked wand cores, dented breastplates, rings that hum with bad decisions. It is where people go when their gear is still good but their luck has started to peel.

[[Suri Brassleaf]] is an artificer with a brain like a trap mechanism and a laugh that disarms nervous customers. [[Old Fen]] appraises items by holding them like they are animals and listening to what he calls "the weight of the past." A runner named [[Kest]] handles deliveries and always seems to have the right key for the wrong door.

In the back room there is a locked cabinet that hums faintly. The label reads: *DO NOT OPEN DURING FESTIVALS.* Suri says it is just "a bad bell." Old Fen will not stand near it.
