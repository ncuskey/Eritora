If you arrive in [[Turnbuckle Town]] by road, odds are you arrive with the Path-to-Adventure Coachline. Their wagons and carriages roll in daily, stacked with supplies, sponsors, and would-be legends practicing their smiles before the gate.

[[Tavin Rook]] is a former team manager who realized there was more money in getting heroes to town than sending them into a dungeon. His best driver, [[Lysa Hobb]], is famous for never tipping a carriage no matter how bad the road gets. The yard guard, [[Brann Coil]], looks like a statue until someone tries to skip payment.
