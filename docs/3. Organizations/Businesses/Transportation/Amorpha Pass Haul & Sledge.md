"North wind? We charge extra."

**Owner:** [[Garrick Vane]]
**Location:** North Yard, [[Turnbuckle Town]]
**Number in Employ:** 16 drivers, 24 muleteers, 9 snow guides, 2 smiths
**Known For:** Winter runs through [[Amorpha Pass]] and freight that arrives intact

Amorpha Pass Haul & Sledge brings in what the town pretends it doesn't need: coal, iron, timber, salt, and the quiet people who avoid the fanfare of the southern road. When the snow comes, their sledges keep moving while other traffic turns back.

[[Garrick Vane]] is blunt and proud of it. His best guide, [[Suri Palehill]], claims she can smell an avalanche an hour before it happens. At the forge, [[Moss Tinker]] keeps runners sharp and tongues sharper, and is rumored to fix more than just metal.
