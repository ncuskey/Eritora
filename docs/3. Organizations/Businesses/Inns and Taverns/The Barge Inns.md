## Overview
The Barge Inns are series of inn and taverns on the dock side block in [[West Docks]]. These establishments and their accommodations are aimed at the working folks who keep [[Turnbuckle Town]] running. This is not the kind of place a tourist would end up, and if they did, they might live to regret it. 

## The Barge Inns 

### Below Deck Tavern and Inn
The most respectable of the Barge Inns. But still not respectable.

### The Swaying Hammock Inn
A inn that is just one large room with hundreds of hammocks hanging from the ceilings.

### Sail Cloth Sleepary
The cheapest inn in [[Turnbuckle Town]] at only 1cp per night. Good luck getting a room. 

### Dockside Inn and Tavern
The original establishment of The Barge Inns. Has a historic reputation and is a right of passage for any of [[The Dewmist River]] Ferrymen. 

### Bail the Ale Tavern
In this tavern you are seated inside of a defunct row boat. The boat is filled with ale and you aren't allowed to leave until you have 'Bailed the Ale'. Not for the faint of heart. Cost for a boat is 5sp and can be split by 6 people.
