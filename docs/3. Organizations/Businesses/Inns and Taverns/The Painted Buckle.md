"Tea, talk, and the truth if you can afford it."

**Owner:** [[Madam Olyra]]
**Location:** Upper Row, [[Turnbuckle Town]]
**Number in Employ:** 16 staff, 2 performers, 1 private security team
**Known For:** Buckle Bloom Tea and private booths with perfect soundproofing

The Painted Buckle is calm in the way a drawn blade is calm. The tables are spaced just far enough apart to feel private, the curtains are heavy, and the service is too good for the price to make sense. Merchants come here to celebrate. Sponsors come here to bargain. Adventurers come here when they want to be seen without being heard.

[[Madam Olyra]] greets everyone like an old friend and remembers what you wish she didn't. [[Tarn Quickstep]] is a server with a cheerful face and an incredible talent for hearing through walls. At night, [[Vessa "Velvet" Rune]] reads fortunes with painted cards and never seems surprised by what she finds.

One booth is rented nearly every night by someone wearing a different face each time. Sometimes they pay in gold. Sometimes they pay in information. Madam Olyra always accepts both.
