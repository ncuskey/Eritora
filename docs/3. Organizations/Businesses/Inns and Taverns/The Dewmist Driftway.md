"Sleep before the gates. Lie if you must."

**Owner:** [[Maela Drift]]
**Location:** River bend outside town, on the [[Dewmist River]]
**Number in Employ:** 10 staff, 4 fishers, 1 doorkeeper
**Known For:** Cheap beds, strong soup, and a back room that never gets described the same way twice

The Driftway is the last stop for many travelers before [[Turnbuckle Town]] swallows them. It sits low to the river, half on stilts, and is always damp in a way that makes people speak softly. The soup is good, the beds are crowded, and the conversations are careful.

[[Maela Drift]] smiles like she has already forgiven you. [[Hobb "Stitch" Marn]] keeps the kitchen running and never asks why someone is bleeding. At the door, [[Tern Halewick]] decides who gets in and who gets redirected down the road.

Some guests swear they saw a lantern out on the [[Dewmist River]] that matched the ferry code perfectly—far from any boat, far from any dock. Maela insists it’s just fog playing tricks. Tern locks the shutters anyway.
