**Owner:** [[Captain Lorn Dask]]

**Known For:** Spruce-Tip Toddy and the Oar Board (names carved for rescues)

Oath n Oars sits close enough to the river that the floorboards keep the smell of wet wood. It is a favorite for guides, haulers, and the people who get hired when a curated adventure goes wrong and someone needs to be found fast. The place is calmer than the Bent Nail, but not safer—fewer fists, more knives, more old vows.

[[Captain Lorn Dask]] is a former ferryman who knows [[The Dewmist River]] like a map he refuses to share. [[Etta Mire]] cooks stew that settles the stomach and makes people cry without knowing why. At night, [[Nim the Bellringer]] plays a set of handbells and can mimic nearly any tune that a crowd hums first.

Last week a boat drifted in empty, tied off clean, and still dripping with seawater that does not belong in the [[Cathadras Valley]]. Lorn says it was "just a prank." Nobody who works the river believes him.
