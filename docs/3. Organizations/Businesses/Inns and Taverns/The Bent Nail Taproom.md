"Loud drinks for louder stories"

**Owner:** [[Harl "Hardsmile" Wren]]
**Location:** [[Mines District]]
**Number in Employ:** 14 staff, 2 bouncers, 1 "unofficial" healer
**Known For:** The Bent Nail Bitter (served with a stamped nail souvenir)

The Bent Nail is where most working adventurers end up after a long day in the valley. The ceiling is low, the tables are scarred, and the walls are crowded with dented helms and broken blade tips labeled with names and dates. The place runs hot and fast, and the crowd is usually split between locals from the [[Mines District]] and visitors who are trying to talk like locals.

[[Harl "Hardsmile" Wren]] claims he can tell which [[CAd]] a person just ran by the way they walk in the door. The bouncer, [[Sella Kint]], keeps the peace with a polite smile and a book of grudges. Two halfling servers, [[Pip]] and [[Pop]], move like a paired spell—always in the right place, always hearing more than they should.
