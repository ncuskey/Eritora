Goblin Games is the third largest and fifth most profitable CAd company in [[Eritora]]. Run by the ancestors of the Goblin clans defeated by [[Valinthor the Great]] in the [[War of the FireStorm]], Goblin Games offers an unhinged adventuring experience for a fraction of the price. Some have argued that Goblin Games toes the line between a safe, curated experience and actual adventure. An investigation by [[The Turnbuckle Times]] in 2067 showed that Goblin Games had been using the adventurers to complete actual real world quests only to keep the actual loot for the company. This investigation led to the creation of the [[Quest, Adventure, and Dungeon Administration]] in 2071.
