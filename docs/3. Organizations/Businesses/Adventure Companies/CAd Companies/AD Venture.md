AD Venture is the most profitable, oldest and most well respected [[CAd]] company in [[Turnbuckle Town]]. Started by [[Dormind MacColough]] in the year 2097 [[PCE]] the business was past down to his son [[Dormind MacColough II]] and then again to his grandson [[Dormind MacColough III]]. 

AD Venture specializes in highly elaborate, exquisitely designed adventures of all types. They are best known for their [[Fetch]], [[Investigate]] and [[Combination]] quests but have received a 5-sword rating and the [[Adventure of the Year]] award in all adventure categories. 

As of the year 2103 [[PCE]] AD Venture began offering custom built adventures for their wealthiest clients. These adventures would be crafted over months or years and would be specifically designed for the client. Often these adventures would come with expensive custom crafted magical items, designed by AD Ventures award winning team or sorcerers, wizards and artificers. These custom adventures have received a lot of public recognition and have really set AD Venture as the primary and best [[CAd]] buisness. 

Since [[Dormind MacColough III]]'s take over of the company in 2102 [[PCE]] the business has been accused of shading dealings. Some have accused AD Venture of purchasing monsters illegally and bringing the dead to life without written consent. [[The Turnbuckle Times]] published and expose in 2110 about [[Dormind MacColough III]] and massive sums unexplainable GP in AD Ventures end of year wares. While the article was quite the scandal when it appeared, the promise of the greatest [[Questings]] yet has made quite most naysayers. 

AD Venture will be the primary host of the 2113 [[Questings]] and has already spent a record 11 million GP on the games as of January 16th, 2113 according to [[The Turnbuckle Times]].
