Do not ask about the black manor at the top of the hill.

If you think you saw an eerie glow coming from a window or two, you didn't. If you think you saw a group of black-cowled figures knocking an elaborate rhythm onto the heavy doors, you didn't. If you think you saw a gilded palanquin entering Turnbuckle's main thoroughfare from a hidden pathway at the base of the hill, you didn't. And if you think you recognized its occupant, you are mistaken.
