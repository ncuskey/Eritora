_A 2nd–3rd level adventure for D&D 5E (Winghorn Press)_
#level2 #level3 

## Prep Summary

- **Premise:** A “wolf problem” is wrecking Welton’s farms and stealing whole flocks. The village offers **800 gp** to end it.

- **Twist:** The wolves are **intelligent, speak Common**, and have leaders with **elemental breath weapons**. Their intelligence comes from a missing local sorcerer.

- **Key NPCs:** [[The Wolves of Welton#Father Johan Merriksonn|Father Johan Merriksonn]]  (priest, wants people fed), [[The Wolves of Welton#Tillus Merrion|Tillus Merrion]] (trade-obsessed council head), [[The Wolves of Welton#Corel|Corel]] (shepherd guide), [[The Wolves of Welton#Leanor Slatebeard|Leanor Slatebeard]] (innkeeper), [[The Wolves of Welton#Willen Featherock|Willen Featherock]] (traumatized survivor).

- **Likely conflicts:** Kill-the-wolves contract vs. moral/strategic choice to negotiate; internal wolf-pack schism (**Flame vs Bolt**).

- **Reveals:** Wolves can talk; “Lightbringer” (Alexi) vanished in a magical event; wolves may be reasoned with after bloodshed.
---

## Adventure Hooks

- Welton as a road-stop where the party hears about trouble.

- Or the party learns of a council contract offering 800 gp to wipe out a wolf pack (notably generous).


---

# Scene 1: Welcome to the Welton Wolfpack

## Setup

On the road through the western hills, the party sees shepherds moving sheep through a bend between rocks and woodland. Wolves ambush.

## Encounter: Wolf Raid

- **Starting distance:** PCs begin **150 ft** from the action.

- **Enemies:** **8× [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]]** 

- **Wolf goal:** steal sheep, not murder shepherds.


### Tactics

- Half the [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]] keep shepherds busy (biting limbs, not going for kills) while the others grab sheep and retreat west.

- [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]] may “test” the party for a couple rounds, then **retreat into woods** if outmatched.

### Aftermath

Shepherds ask escort back to Welton, share rumors (below), no meaningful reward.

## Shaggy Wolf Stories (Gossip)

- Sorcerer [[The Wolves of Welton#Alexi Merriksonn|Alexi Merriksonn]] (Father Merriksonn’s brother) vanished; people wonder if it’s connected.

- Sheep stolen from a locked barn on Spurrok’s Hill.

- Trader Wheatly chased off his cart; horses and thick leather stolen; wolves “appeared as if by magic.”

- A shepherd heard _begging calls_ in the trees; while investigating, his sheep vanished.

- A village hunting party was ambushed deeper in the woods; reports of thunder and bursts of fire. Halfling [[The Wolves of Welton#Willen Featherock|Willen Featherock]] was badly hurt and later found dumped near the woods, now haunted by “voices.”



# Scene 2: Village People (Welton)

## Welton Overview

A white-walled riverside farming village (wheat and sheep). Humans are the majority, with many halflings and a few dwarves. Lately, streets are muddy from traffic; people look worried and hungry.

## Key Location: The Shepherd’s Crook (Inn)

Old, large inn opposite the Growers’ Hall and Fleecers’ Hall; crowded due to displaced folk.

- **Innkeepers:** [[The Wolves of Welton#Leanor Slatebeard|Leanor Slatebeard]] (dwarf woman) runs the bar; **Banteth** handles kitchen/brewing.

- If PCs say they’re here to help: free round + meal after talking to the council.

- Asking about Featherock: Leanor directs them to his room, asks the party to be gentle.


## The Council Meeting

A plain meeting room with a large table and **8 chairs** (all filled): 5 human men, 1 human woman, 2 halflings (one male, one female).

- [[The Wolves of Welton#Tillus Merrion|Tillus Merrion]] argues with [[The Wolves of Welton#Father Johan Merriksonn|Father Merriksonn]] about exporting food vs feeding locals.

- Council offers: **800 gp**, free lodging, small favors if party takes the job.  

### What the council knows

- Wolves steal livestock in bulk (sheep, cattle, pigs, chickens).

- Wolves show **unusual tactics**: ambushes, opening gates, pulling down fences.

- Escalation: in **3 months**, wolves went from nuisance to major threat.

- A posse tried hunting them; got driven back.

- Their “protector,” [[The Wolves of Welton#Alexi Merriksonn|Alexi]] (sorcerer), went missing around when attacks began.

- Werewolf suspicion: Father notes multiple full moons with no curse signs.


### Corel (Fleecers’ Guild)

Introduces himself as [[The Wolves of Welton#Corel|Corel]], longtime hill-worker. Offers environmental knowledge and general support.

## Featherock’s Room

[[The Wolves of Welton#Willen Featherock|Willen Featherock]] lies feverish and injured (bandaged arm and leg).  
He remembers gruff voices and a strong grip on his ankle during the ambush. If believed, he admits: **the wolves were talking**, arguing about whether to eat him. Then he breaks down and refuses more.

---

# Scene 3: Plan of Attack (Finding the Lair)

No single solution—let the party drive.

## Where the den is

A hollow beyond the western woods on the hillsides west of Welton.

## Corel as helper

- Suggests tracking into western woods.

- Offers his own flock as bait.

- If no tracker: he reluctantly volunteers as guide.

	- Use [[Commoner (NPC)|Commoner]] with **WIS 14** and **Survival +4**.


## If bait is used

- **6 [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]]** attack using Scene 1 tactics.

- If PCs try talking: wolves may say a few words, then flee in confusion.


## Travel

- Woods are thick, mossy, and noisy with small animals; occasional lone wolf howls.

- **Crossing time:** ~**4 hours** at walking pace.


### Skill check guidelines

- Track wolf: **WIS (Survival) DC 14** (DC 16 if tracks > 8 hours old)

- Track wolf carrying prey: **WIS (Survival) DC 11** (DC 13 if tracks > 8 hours old)

- Hide from wolves: **DEX (Stealth)** vs wolf **WIS (Perception) +3**, wolves have advantage on scent/sound

- Wolf habits: **WIS (Nature) DC 12**


---

# Scene 4: The Owlbear’s Picnic (Optional)

Adds combat/texture mid-journey.

## Encounter: Injured Owlbear

After ~2 hours in the western woods:

- **Enemy:** [[Owlbear]] , limping, thin, wounded
	- **Max HP reduced to 40**, otherwise normal.
	- **Behavior:** starving and desperate; fights to the death (no retreat).


## Clues (after kill)

- Wounds from **wolf jaws**; **WIS (Nature) DC 12** confirms, and that they’re a couple weeks old.

- Also **scorch marks** on fur.

- **DC 10 WIS** or Nature proficiency: wolves rarely challenge owlbears; owlbears are **nocturnal** and shouldn’t be out in daylight.


---

# Scene 5: The Den’s Denizens (Wolf Lair)

## Exterior

Cave system at western edge of the woods.

- Cave mouth: ~**10 ft wide**, ~**10 ft tall** at highest.

- **Smoke plume** rises from a point ~**30 ft** back from entrance (hole in ceiling).

- Outside: **6 [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]]** doing organized tasks (fire-sitting, fence work, tearing sheep carcass). Many wear bright cloth/decorations.


### Perimeter trap

- **Tripwires** at treeline: **WIS (Perception) DC 13** to spot.
    
- Triggering sets off **bone noisemakers**.
    

## The Back Door (Ceiling hole)

- Hole is ~30 ft behind entrance; just big enough for a small creature to squeeze.
    
- Opens into the far-right chamber, **15 ft above the ground**, directly above the fire.
    

### Overheard argument

If listening in: **Flame** and **Bolt** argue:

- Flame: wants more aggression, start killing to force retreat.

- Bolt: wants smaller raids, then disappear deeper into wilderness.


---

## Inside the Cave

Complex: **large central chamber + three sub-chambers**.

### Central chamber (living/sleeping)

- Rudimentary beds (leaves/cloth), bone piles.

- Charcoal/ash wall art: hunting wolves + a human who shares gifts, then disappears.
    - **WIS (Perception) DC 12:** notice the “story” sequence.

### Western sub-chamber (storeroom + stolen sheep)

- Bags of thick leather and homespun wool.

- Pile of mundane gear: knives, shovel, etc.

- Further in: crude but effective fence of branches (some tool-shaped); constant loud bleating.
    
### Central sub-chamber (nursery)

- ~Half a dozen wolf pups; guarded by **2 wolves** who defend to the death.

- If combat: use [[Cat (Creature)|Cat]] stats for pups.


### Eastern sub-chamber (leadership meeting room)

- Only chamber with a fire; smoke exits through roof hole; otherwise empty.

---

## Big Bad Wolves (Confrontation)

If wolves notice the party (noise, failed stealth, walking in), they panic and howl; one growls **“HUNTERS”** in Common.

### Escalation

Unless the party defuses:

- Wolves attack fiercely.

- If fight is outside: **Flame + Bolt** appear after **1 full round**, with **4 wolves in crude leather armor (+1 AC)**.


### Break point

Bolt attempts to stop the fight if any occur:

- **4 wolves killed**, _or_

- **Flame or Bolt < half HP**, _or_

- **A PC reduced to 0 HP**  
    If ignored, wolves fight to the death.


### Combat tactics

- Wolves are intelligent; maximize [[Wolf (Creature)#^e4f366|Pack Tactics]].

- Use speed to flank; focus poorly-armored backliners.

- Flame/Bolt lead front; use breath weapons.
    - Bolt avoids friendly fire; Flame doesn’t mind catching allies if it hits PCs.

---

## Let’s Talk This Over (Negotiation)

Bolt will negotiate.

### Bolt’s explanation (the twist)

- Pack became intelligent after attacking [[The Wolves of Welton#Alexi Merriksonn|Alexi Merriksonn]] (the missing sorcerer) trespassing on their territory.

- A **bright flash** occurred; “Lightbringer” vanished; wolves awoke smarter, able to speak, with dreamlike knowledge.

- They drove off the owlbear and took its den.

- They hoard sheep so pups/elderly don’t starve; want a better life.


### Flame’s stance

Aggressive, wants to punish and kill “civilized races,” claims land is theirs by right.

### Bolt’s offer

He dislikes Welton’s history of killing wolves, but will attempt settlement:

- Wolves control woods and uninhabited lands west

- In exchange: keep area free of other predators and stop raiding.


---

# Scene 6: Settling the Scores (Endgame)

Two main endings depending on party choices.

## If the party refuses to negotiate

- Most wolves likely dead by end.

- Party can return to Welton to claim the contract reward.

- In the cave: a dozen pups guarded by 2 desperate wolves who beg to leave forever.
    - If pups threatened, adults fight to the death while urging pups to flee.


## If the party negotiates with the wolves

- A peaceful accord may be possible _once Flame is defeated_.

- If a deal seems close: Flame calls Bolt a coward, **attacks him from behind**, badly injures him (removes him from the fight).

- Armored wolves join Flame for a final desperate assault; others fall back in fear/confusion.

### Outcomes back in Welton

- If wolves agree to leave: party can collect reward.

- If party lies (“we wiped them out”): **CHA (Deception)** vs **Father Merriksonn’s WIS (Insight) +5**; he confronts privately.

- If proposing a treaty:
    - Father Merriksonn + Corel support negotiation.
    - Tillus (and much of council) needs convincing:
	    - Requires a solid argument + **DC 15 CHA (Persuasion)** to sway Tillus.

    - If Tillus won’t budge: Corel calls a vote.
        - Party makes **DC 12 CHA (Persuasion)** checks vs each of the **five remaining council members** (adv/disadv per argument).
        - Corel + Father vote “negotiate” automatically; need **3 successes** to win majority.
        - If outvoted: Tillus leaves the council “a broken man,” never returns.
- If wolf intelligence becomes public: Featherock recovers faster and thanks the party.
