## Summary

The party’s attempt to grab a rare afternoon of downtime is interrupted by a frantic sheep equipped with a Scroll of Speak to Animals and a fierce determination to get their attention. With the aid of some magic, the creature reveals itself to be no mere beast, but a wizard who fell victim to an embittered apprentice and a stolen Wand of True Polymorph.

After two years imprisoned with nothing to eat but his own lawn, the ex-elf has escaped and is in dire need of aid. Transformed assassins are looking to grab themselves a mutton dinner, while the only object capable of restoring his opposable thumbs lies in the hands of his former pupil and current nemesis. Fortunately, the wooly wizard has found new allies he can rely on, right?

Can the heroes put an end to Ahmed Noke’s transmutational tyranny and restore an innocent wizard to his true form? There’s only one way to find out...

## How to Use This Adventure

The main text is divided into several distinct scenes, each covering a location, encounter, or major plot point. These usually have several ways for the players to advance the story, but are by no means exhaustive. Other information, enemy stat blocks, and notes are highlighted in grey boxes.

This is followed by maps, detailed character descriptions, and roleplaying notes.

While it is possible to run the game on the fly, it is recommended that you read the adventure in its entirety before starting to play.

---

## Adventure Hooks

Getting the players into this adventure is pretty straight-forward. All that is required is that they be walking down the street in a town or city large enough to host a wizard.

If you want to plant seeds in advance, you may wish to introduce the character of [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]]through rumors or idle conversation with shopkeepers and innkeepers, who view him with fear and awe.

---

## Scene 1: Baaaa-d News

The game begins with the party idling away an afternoon. They might be enjoying a drink at a tavern, resting at their base of operations, or simply walking down the street without a care in the world. No matter where they are, however, it soon becomes clear that something quite odd is happening.

There is a sound of clattering hooves, surprised yelps, and a frantic bleating. Before the party can react, a sheep bounds towards them. The beast appears to be a regular sheep in every way—fluffy white coat, black face, curled horns—but it is carrying an elaborate scroll in its mouth.

The sheep tries to get close to the most magically-gifted member of the party and waves the scroll at them, letting them take it should they reach for it.

A wax seal purports that it is a [[Speak with Animals|Scroll of Speak with Animals (modified)]] (lasts 8 hours). If a character says this out loud—to explain to other party members, for example—the sheep appears to nod and bleat enthusiastically.

Should they use the scroll, all of them hear the sheep’s baaing instantly morph into cultured, elven-accented Common, albeit with a slight hint of a bleat.

After establishing that the player can understand what it’s saying, the sheep introduces itself as [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Finethir Shinebright]], a [[Wizard]] in dire need of aid. If the players are willing to listen, he explains that he recognizes them as adventurers and that he is in dire need of their aid.

Specifically, he wants them to help take back an extremely powerful magical artifact from a dangerous, possibly insane [[Wizard]].

He will attempt to tell his story, but shortly after he starts the sound of howling fills the air…

### Shinebright’s Story

Until two years ago [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Finethir Shinebright]] owned and worked out of a tower on the outskirts of town. He was a wizard of no small talent, specializing in [[1. Spellcasting#^7c7190|Transmutation]] magic. His most prized possession—and probably the key to his success—was an incredibly rare [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Modified Wand of True Polymorph|Wand of True Polymorph]], which he used to work many wonders on behalf of local officials, nobles, and merchants.

However, one fateful night he ended from his meditative trance to find his apprentice, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Ahmed Noke]], standing over him, clutching the wand. [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] demanded to know what the boy was doing, but the only noise he could produce was an angry “baaaaah”. It was already too late.

With the wand representing his only chance of salvation, the wizard became a virtual prisoner in his own garden. He was forced to graze on nothing but grass and buttercups while hungry wolves and other beasts—actually polymorphed guards—looked on.

Last night he felt hope for the first time in many months when [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] left his home without closing the door. [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] snuck in, made his way to an old bookshelf, and stole the [[Speak with Animals|Scroll of Speak with Animals]].

He then rushed into town with the scroll clenched between his teeth, and was searching desperately for the aura of magic that would indicate someone able to activate the spell when he found the party.

### Answers to Tricky Questions

**Why come to us and not the authorities?**  
Who would trust the word of a sheep over a respected and feared wizard?

**Doesn’t Speak With Animals only last 10 minutes?**  
The scroll uses a version of the spell modified by [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] and can last up to eight hours.

**Why do you need the wand? Can’t any wizard turn you back?**  
[[True Polymorph]] is a 9th level spell, so unless the town the adventure is set in boasts an extremely prestigious magical university it's extremely unlikely that anyone nearby can cast it.

## Scene 2: Shepherds, Crooks

If the party is in public a huge Half-Orc swaggers towards them, pushing through the crowd without a care for angry yells left in his wake. If they are in their base of operations or anywhere private, he settles for violently hammering on the door.

He’s accompanied by a trio of [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]] with strangely intelligent eyes and a shadowy, hulking figure that stands at least eight feet tall wearing a dirty brown cloak.

The half-Orc, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Guz|Guz]] demands that he be given “Master Noke’s sheep.” He says it escaped, and is of great sentimental value to his master. Any mention of Shinebright’s true nature is met with hollow, mirthless laughter.

[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Guz|Guz]] is not a bright fellow, but he is very loyal and determined to complete his task. His trackers know that [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] is there, no matter how well the party tries to hide him, and he will not take no for an answer. While he would prefer to work through violence and intimidation, he is also willing to offer bribes and promises of magical favours if that looks like the best option.

If he feels like he’s not making progress, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Guz|Guz]] will simply attack without warning. The wolves will follow him up, while the cloaked figure will let its hood fall, revealing that it is in fact a polymorphed [[Brown Bear (Creature)|Brown Bear]]).

### Stat Block: Guz

**Guz**  
*Medium half-orc, chaotic neutral*

- **Armor Class** 14 (leather armour)  
- **Hit Points** 67 (9d8 + 27)  
- **Speed** 30 ft.

|     STR |     DEX |     CON |    INT |     WIS |    CHA |
| ------: | ------: | ------: | -----: | ------: | -----: |
| 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 17 (+3) | 8 (-1) | 11 (+0) | 8 (+1) |

- **Skills** Intimidation +2  
- **Senses** passive perception 10  
- **Languages** Common, Orc  
- **Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**Reckless.** [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Guz|Guz]] can choose to gain advantage on all melee weapon attacks during his turn, but in return all attack rolls against him also have advantage until the start of his next turn.

#### Actions

**Whirling Greatsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., two targets. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

### Combat Tactics

The exact details of any battle that breaks out will depend on the location. If it takes place in an inn, tables and overturned chairs litter the floor. In a street, you may wish to have frightened passers-by form zones of difficult terrain.

All of the beasts still have an intelligent human mind contained within them, and act intelligently. [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Guz|Guz]] is happy to charge into the front line and take on any heavy hitters alongside the [[Brown Bear (Creature)|Brown Bear]].

Meanwhile the [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]] will aim to cut round behind the party in a bid to grab [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] (use the statistics of a [[Pony (Creature)|Pony]] but with INT and WIS scores of 18 and 14 respectively). They intend to capture [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]], not kill him.

### After the Dust has Settled

Once [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke's]] goons have been defeated, distracted, or otherwise dealt with, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] pleads with the party. Without their help, he is doomed. [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] still has many guards still working for him and eventually they will find him.

If they’re feeling mercenary, he reminds the party that in his true form he is a powerful and wealthy wizard and promises great rewards. He is more than willing to commit to deals that he knows he can't actually fulfill.

In any case, in order to turn back into his original form [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] needs another dose of [[True Polymorph]]. Which means he needs access to his old wand.

The sheep explains that his former apprentice still dwells in his old home, located just to the southeast of town. He keeps the wand on him at all times and only leaves if he absolutely has to.

[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] knows his old home’s layout ([[Shinebright Tower.png|Shinebright Tower]]) intimately, and is more than happy to describe it in endless detail.

If [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Guz|Guz]] captures him, he and his allies will set off for Noke’s home. The party will have to decide if they follow, potentially launching a chase scene.

---

## Scene 3: The House in the Woods
The path to Noke’s Tower cuts off from a main road a few miles out of town, darting off between a gap in the bushes. It is a well-trodden route that soon begins to weave its way between tall oak trees.

Anyone who cares to examine the path for tracks will easily see the impression of many feet and paws, with the most fresh sets appearing to match up with the group led by Guz.

The track continues through sparse woodland for perhaps a mile without any sign of habitation. Unless they know what to look for, the party may be surprised by the view that awaits them when Shinebright’s old house appears through the treetops.

### Tree House

Rather than stone or glass, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] fashioned his home from the living branches of four sturdy oak trees. These have been shaped and woven to create three thick platforms.

- **Garden / lowest platform:** roughly 40 ft across and about 10 ft from the ground. The only obvious route up is a gentle slope formed of roots and branches that connects roughly with the main path. The branches that form its base are roughly bowl-shaped, and from the floor it’s possible to see flowers and small trees growing around its edge. The rest forms a garden with a well-trimmed lawn ringed and bisected by a stone path.

- **Middle platform:** the largest, diameter roughly 60 ft, about 20 ft above the ground, fully enclosed with branches with a roof of woven twigs. There are around a dozen evenly spaced, window-sized gaps, as well as what appears to be a door at the point closest to the garden platform.

  Entry is provided by branches that grow to link it with the garden platform when the passphrase is spoken. The passphrase is **“Mae Tref Cathode,”** the name of Shinebright’s ancestral home in a local dialect. The bridge can be activated from both ends.

  Inside it is divided up into three sections: a combination library and lab, a sitting room, and a dining room/kitchen. Untidy bookshelves line much of the outer walls and worktables are covered with stacks of ink-spattered notes and complicated anatomical diagrams of various beasts and monsters. At night it is warmly lit by a series of enchanted lamps set in sconces.

- **Top platform:** roughly 30 ft above the ground, accessible by another branch slope from the second platform. Only about 15 ft across, functioning as a bedroom for Noke, containing little beyond a wardrobe, a large wooden bed, and a cluttered dressing table.

Scattered beneath the platforms are two small huts, apparently also fashioned from enchanted wood, and a large outhouse. The huts contain one or two beds each (a few oversized), as well as the general detritus of the common men who occupy them.

### Clever Girl…

[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] is naturally paranoid and Shinebright’s recent escape hasn’t exactly improved his outlook. This makes luring him away from the safety of his tower an extremely difficult task, though not an impossible one.

Noke’s lust for fame and power slightly outweighs his fear of being unseated, for the time being at least. This means that a very, very skilled set of liars with a sufficiently devious plan and a good helping of luck may be able to tempt him with the offer of a particularly prestigious, lucrative contract.

Even so, when [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] leaves he will take all of his remaining bodyguards with him and will be extremely quick to suspect the party of betrayal if there is any hint of a double-cross.

He will, of course, have his wand to hand at all times. Should he be given enough time to cast it, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] will use a charge of [[True Polymorph]] to transmute some nearby item into a Wyrmling that uses roughly the same stats as the [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Stat Block Bed Dragon Wyrmling|Bed Dragon Wyrmling]] (see below). Depending on what it was made from, it may not have the same flavor and might need to have its resistances/vulnerabilities tweaked slightly.

### Stat Block: Bed Dragon Wyrmling

**Bed Dragon Wyrmling**  
*Large dragon, chaotic neutral*

- **Armor Class** 16 (natural armour)  
- **Hit Points** 70 (10d8 + 20)  
- **Speed** 30 ft., climb 30 ft., fly 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 19 (+4) | 14 (+2) | 17 (+3) | 8 (-1) | 8 (-1) | 4 (-3) |

- **Skills** Perception +2, Stealth +5  
- **Senses** passive perception 12  
- **Damage Vulnerabilities** fire  
- **Languages** —  
- **Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP)

#### Actions

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

**Splinter Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The Bed Dragon Wyrmling sends out a shower of wooden splinters in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity save, taking 24 (7d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. ^b3c8a3

### Showdown?

When the party arrives at the compound, there is a pair of [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]] either sleeping or playing with an oversized pair of dice on the lawn, marking scores on a slate with claws. A [[Brown Bear (Creature)|Brown Bear]] is in the outhouse, taking care of business.

[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] will be in the central platform, working furiously on new spells. If he notices the party as they approach he will order them to “return the sheep and in return I will not destroy you all.”

If they talk, he will reveal his reasons for hating [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] and boast disjointedly of his own achievements. He will also ask if they killed “my man, Guz,” and be visibly upset if they have.

Should they refuse to return [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] despite his pleas, orders, and attempts at bribery, he will order his men to attack.

### Combat Tactics

The most important part of this fight is Noke, who is offensively weak but can buff up his allies dramatically. Once the [[Brown Bear (Creature)|Brown Bear]] emerges from the outhouse he will cast [[Enlarge-Reduce]] on it in a bid to increase its damage. He will supplement his minions’ damage with [[Ray of Frost]] but that’s about it, as he will focus on keeping up concentration.

The two [[Wolf (Creature)|Wolves]] will act intelligently, darting around to attack casters and other weak targets while the [[Brown Bear (Creature)|Brown Bear]] blocks the path up towards Noke. However, **the polymorphed guards are not likely to fight to the death and will flee once they fall below half health.**

Once it becomes clear that the fight is lost, or a player simply gets too close to him, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] will cast [[Haste]] ) or [[Expeditious Retreat]], flee into the central platform, lock the door behind him, and retract the bridge. He will move to his bedroom as fast as he can and casts [[True Polymorph]] on his bed, which is the largest thing he can find.

Three rounds after he runs away he bursts from the roof of his bedroom riding the Bed Dragon Wyrmling—a beast that looks like a dragon carved from wood, with billowing bedsheets for wings and a tail that ends in a soft pillow. If the party are in the main living area he will crash through the ceiling and attack.

The Wyrmling is not that smart and will use its [[A Wild Sheep Chase#^b3c8a3|Splinter Breath]] as often as possible, simply trying to attack the closest target when it is not available. **It will, however, prioritize enemies that use fire against it.** While riding the Wyrmling, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] will simply use [[Ray of Frost]] to slow down any party members trying to retreat.

### A Messy End

Should the Wyrmling be lost—either to damage or because [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] loses concentration—it will turn back into a plain old bed.

Desperate and unwilling to let his old master win, a babbling [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] will attempt to use the wand on himself, intending to transmute his form into that of some monstrous creature. However, the over-used wand will crackle, fizz, and malfunction with a loud bang, turning [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] into a misshapen pile of flesh. For a few moments the steaming, oozing meat will twitch and moan. Then the ruined mess of the thing that was [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] will sag, never to move again.

### Not Like This…

While the chain of events set out in Scene 3 cover the most likely outcomes, remember that nothing is set in stone.

A stealthy party may be able to steal the wand while [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] sleeps, while a combination of lucky rolls and inventive tactics may allow a player to disarm the wizard before he gets the chance to transmute his bed, let alone himself.

Should this happen, don’t force the story back towards the “ideal path” presented above, but allow it to develop naturally. The character descriptions at the back of the adventure should allow you work out how [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] and [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] may react when they come face-to-face.

One thing that you must do, however, is try to provide at least a hint of the dangers associated with the modified wand before the players try and use it. Possibly it sparks unnaturally when a character touches it, drawing attention to the cracks running its length, or [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] himself may feel honor-bound to warn them.

### Stat Block: Ahmed Noke

**Ahmed Noke**  
*Medium Human, Neutral Evil*

- **Armor Class** 12  
- **Hit Points** 35 (7d8)  
- **Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 9 (-1) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | X (+X) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) |

- **Saving Throws** Int +5, Will +4  
- **Skills** Arcana +6  
- **Senses** passive perception 12  
- **Languages** Common, Elven, Dwarven, Draconic  
- **Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

## Scene 4: Big Choices

Should the players recover the wand it becomes immediately obvious that it is damaged. Anyone proficient in Arcana can tell that it has been modified so it can be used more often, but overuse has rendered it extremely unreliable.

If they wish to speak to Shinebright, a quick search of the central platform will allow them to find another [[Speak with Animals|Scroll of Speak with Animals]]. At the sight of his former apprentice’s ruined corpse, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] may even undergo some realization of how poorly he treated his former apprentice and turn somber despite his triumph.

[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] is willing to risk his own death in order to be turned back into an elf. However, he is also open to persuasion if the party try to talk him out of it.

Before undergoing the risk of having the spell performed on him, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] will ask that if he does die, the party give word to his old college.

### Consequences

**If the party performs the spell and it succeeds:**  
[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] congratulates the party heartily. He will have to be reminded of anything he actually promised them while he was still a sheep, and cannot actually pay any financial reward, as [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] was virtually bankrupt and had sold most items to pay for research materials and guards.

He will, however, be willing to perform transmutations of up to 5th level for them, charging just enough to cover the components. He will also take in any polymorphed guards who fled, promising to work towards returning them to their natural shapes.

**If the party performs the spell and it fails:**  
[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] dies permanently. The party is free to honour his final wish and leave the tower more-or-less intact, or loot to their hearts’ content. The tower is surprisingly empty of anything of benefit to non-transmuters, however, with valuables restricted to expensive lab equipment and arcane paraphernalia estimated to be worth around 1,000 gp.

If the players wish they can also take the entire tower complex as their own, though this may cause trouble when the local nobles try to pay [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] a visit and find him missing…

**If the party refuse to perform the spell:**  
[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] accepts but will not give up his hopes entirely. He will take back his old home and work towards a way to remove his curse.

In any case, he heads to the bedroom and slips on one of his old robes, which he wears until he is transformed back to his natural shape. Though he will be upset with them, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] will acknowledge that he owes the party a large debt.

## Modified Wand of True Polymorph

Formed of a long, thin twig taken from an oak tree, this wand holds **1d4-1 charges** of True Polymorph, with a minimum of 1. These can be cast by anybody with a spellcasting ability who has spent at least one hour attuning to the wand. The amount of charges resets at dawn each day.

In order to increase the amount of times the spell has been cast, the wand appears to have been fitted with a bulbous, rune-inscribed iron band and has cracks running along its length.

If inspected with a **DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)** check, reveal that the modifications have left the wand extremely unreliable. Each time a charge is used the user must pass a **DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana)** check.

- **Success:** the spell casts normally and the DC needed to use it permanently increases by 1.  
- **Fail by 5 or less:** the spell transmutes the target into a hideous lump of seemingly random limbs, organs, and facial features that is unable to act and dies once 1d4 rounds have passed, not returning to its original form.

  This transformation cannot be undone by any spell lower than 9th level and cannot be cancelled by ending concentration.

  The target can make a saving throw against this effect in the same way they would against a regular casting of True Polymorph.

- **Fail by more than 5:** in addition to the above consequences the wand explodes violently, dealing **1d12 force damage** to all creatures within 10 ft for each charge remaining in the wand. This destroys the wand.

## Characters

### Finethir Shinebright

Arrogant, self-obsessed, and filled with an inflated sense of his own ego, Finethir [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] is one of the people worst suited to be transformed into a sheep. Still, no matter his form the former elven wizard manages to exude an air of fussy, bookish intellectualism.

Left to his own devices, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] will talk at length about himself, his achievements, and his study of the arcane. He shows a staggering inability to notice anybody’s needs or desires and is perfectly capable of ruining friendships or professional relationships completely by accident.

Despite his flaws, however, he is generally good-hearted. Assuming he notices them and it doesn’t inconvenience him too much he will try to help others where possible, though he will loudly complain of their inability to grasp concepts as simple as poly-planal transweave theory.

Once upon a time the local nobles, merchants, and arcanists spoke the name of Finethir [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] with respect, awe, and grudging admiration. A master of transmutation, he would regularly be called upon to carry out grand tasks such as clearing blocked roads by turning massive boulders into rabbits.

Two years as a sheep have taught him very little about humility, but a lot about grass.

If he returns to his natural form, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] is a willow-thin high elf with straw-coloured hair and an extremely long nose. He favors loose blue robes and almost always wears slippers.

#### Key Characteristics

- Arrogant, snobbish, and self-absorbed  
- Kind at heart  
- Incapable of reading social situations  
- Desperately wants his wand back  
### Ahmed Noke

The youngest child of a blacksmith, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] has always been fascinated by the transitory properties different materials could adopt—metal that was soft as treacle one moment could be hard as stone the next.

He left home at just 14 to study the wonders of arcane transmutation, but found college didn’t challenge his abilities. Instead, he abandoned his scholarship and travelled to visit Shinebright, who agreed to take him on as an apprentice.

Though [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] hero-worshipped the legendary Shinebright, the years dragged on and on without any change in their relationship. Decades passed and still the master transmuter treated him like a child, expected to cook, clean, and recite answers by rote. When [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]]pressed him on it, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] would explain that this was how he had been taught, and didn’t seem to register Noke’s claims that, as a human, he couldn’t spare a century to serve out an apprenticeship.

At the same time, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] began to realise that much of Shinebright’s acclaim came not from his own abilities—extensive as they were—but from the Wand of True Polymorph he wielded.

He finally cracked on the night of his 40th birthday, when [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] ignored his request to advance his studies, saying he was too young. After polymorphing his master, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] began to set himself up as a master wizard. However, a combination of guilt and suddenly unstoppered ambition spelled bad news for his mental state.

He is paranoid that someone will attack him as he attacked [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]] and rarely sleeps. This paranoia has led him to invest in a troop of guards, many of whom he has transmuted into stronger, more bestial forms.

With expenses rising and determined to exceed the fame of his former master, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] is keen to take on even grander projects, even if this means pushing the wand to its very limits.

Ahmed is a relatively short, dusky-skinned middle-aged man with untidy salt-and-pepper hair. He wears Shinebright’s old blue robes, which have been badly altered and drag along the floor. He has a nervous habit of gently pinching his left earlobe when under stress.

#### Key Characteristics

- Determined to prove his brilliance  
- Still burns with anger for [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Finethir Shinebright|Shinebright]]  
- Paranoid of losing the wand  
- On the edge of madness  

### Guz

A hulking brute of a half-orc, [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Guz|Guz]] views violence and intimidation as the only sensible methods for achieving his goals and assumes that most people feel the same way.

Though to most outside observers he may appear wholly reprehensible, he is incredibly loyal to Noke—who genuinely doesn’t care what a creature looks like on the outside—and owes him unswerving devotion.

[[A Wild Sheep Chase#Guz|Guz]] isn’t particularly intelligent and can be easily confused by quick-talking foes, though this usually just makes him angrier.

In person he stands well over six feet tall, wears tattered but clean leather armour, and wields an enormous greatsword that he is more than capable of wielding with a single hand.

His hair is woven into a single plait that reaches to the small of his back. He is also fond of trying to use long, complicated words he has picked up from Noke—though the extent to which he actually understands what they mean is up for debate.

#### Key Characteristics

- Incredibly loyal to [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] 
- Works through violence and intimidation  
- Tries to emulate [[A Wild Sheep Chase#Ahmed Noke|Noke]] by using long words  
- Not very intelligent
