## Introduction
**Flow comes first.** Let's play a game where things get done.
- We will keep rule arguments to a minimum
- If you have a hard time with focus, try taking notes
- Have your dice out, and character sheets available

**Immersion is King.** Let's play a game where people are immersed. 
- Respect the scene. Keep meta talk to a minimum.
- Respect the characters. Don't joke when people are roleplaying.
- Respect the ignorance. Artless exposition might be worse than focused ignorance.
- Respect the player. Players can ask for what they need, don't volunteer it unprompted. 

Your world comes second to the PC's story. The PCs are **supposed** to be heros!
