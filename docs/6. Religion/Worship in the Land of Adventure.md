Worship in [[Eritora]] is a rather simple affair for most folks. An affinity for one of the Lesser Aspects and the occasional prayer is all that’s needed in most circles to maintain societal norms. Those searching for greater meaning–or power–in the divine may uncover a direct link to one of the forgotten Greater Aspects, from which all of the Lessers flow.

The vast majority of Eritorans do not realize that their Gods are simply aspects of a greater whole; each is viewed as its own independent deity. As religions formed around these deities, many followers developed their own sects and beliefs about their patrons, often finding themselves at odds with one another over certain aspects of worship and lifestyle. Over time, these sects began to worship the Lesser Aspects of the Gods. 

This has resulted in polite disagreements, duels, tavern brawls, and even wars--often between unwitting disciples of the same God. 

The Greater Aspects, for their part, do not care, as to worship one of their Aspects is to worship the whole, even if the sects themselves do not realize or accept it.

**The Twin Gods**

Siblings Tychos and Astella were born alongside the world of Eritora. These primal beings shaped the world into what it is today–clear blue skies, fresh running water, majestic mountains, roaring seas–and, of course, the wonder of life. Throughout the eons the inseparable pair began to drift apart as their personalities coalesced, resulting in significant differences of opinion: Tychos formed into the God of Fortune, and Astella, the Goddess of Fancy.

### Greater Aspects

Although Tychos and Astella were the first deities of Eritora, two others have since joined them. 

There are vanishingly few members of Eritoran society who are aware of these Gods, let alone worship them. If you choose for your character to follow a Greater Aspect, be sure to have an exceptionally good reason for it, including how the truth was finally uncovered. 

>It's got to be a really good story!!! Or else I'll probably just ask that you pick or create a Lesser Aspect instead. - Josh

The four Greater Aspects at work are:

- [[Tychos, God of Fortune]]
- [[Astella, Goddess of Fancy]]
- [[Jari, God of Daring]]
- [[Desmos, God of Practicality]]

### Lesser Aspects

Lesser Aspects are a more complicated subject. As explained above, they are simply different facets of the Greater Aspects. It is important to note that the Gods themselves do not see any difference between themselves and their Lesser Aspects, as the Lesser Aspects are purely creations of mankind built in eons past to celebrate certain facets or traits of their progenitors. 

Of course, no one in Eritora knows that their patron God is naught but a fragment of a greater whole, butchered, teased into a shape and form more easily understood by priests long dead. 

The lists of Lesser Aspects found on this site is far from exhaustive. There are countless variations, combinations, and blasphemies worshipped around the world. As part of the character creation process, you are welcome--and encouraged--to create your own Lesser Aspect which fits your own designs, and they will be added to the catalogue. Start a cult!
