Astella, Goddess of Fancy is one of two primal forces responsible for the creation of Eritora. As she and her twin Tychos diverged from their singular form, she became focused on ideals of freedom, desire, and curiosity. Like her brother, there are many aspects to the Goddess of Fancy. Some focus on a life free from material wealth, others rankle at the chains of law. Regardless of which Lesser Aspect one worships, however, trust in Astella results in a life of freedom and experience.
