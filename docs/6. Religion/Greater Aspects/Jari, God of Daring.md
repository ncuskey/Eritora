Valinthor the Great may have been Turnbuckle Town’s first hero, but he is far from Eritora’s. Dozens–hundreds–of names, now forgotten, were once held in as high a regard as the Valinthor’s. When the first hero set forth upon the first legendary quest, Jari, God of Daring, was born to witness. 

Aspects of Jari often include themes of bravery and devotion, but can take a darker turn towards treachery and trickery. Followers of the God of Daring’s [[Worship in the Land of Adventure#Lesser Aspects|Lesser Aspects]] all share one quality, no matter how diverse: The willingness to do what others will not.
