The Twin Gods of Eritora abandoned the natural world shortly after its creation, choosing instead to focus on the ideals of their favorite pets: Mankind. No longer were the groves tended by Astella’s gentle hand; Tychos was no longer there to shape the waves. The trees noticed their absence. The mountains shook with anger, the seas receded in resentment. This collective misery brought forth Desmos, the God of Practicality–a God of growth, preservation, and survival. 

The Aspects of Desmos are just as varied as those of the other Gods. Some bring great harvests to their followers; others keep worshippers safe upon the high seas. A few embrace the rage of the wilds, who still suffer from their abandonment at the hands of their creators. Whatever the case may be, worship of an Aspect of the God of Practicality ensures an existence well-grounded in reality.
