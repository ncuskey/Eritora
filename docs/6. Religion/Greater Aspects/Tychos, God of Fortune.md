Tychos, God of Fortune is one of two primal forces responsible for the creation of Eritora. As he and his twin Astella diverged from their singular form, he became focused on ideals of productivity, wealth, and the creation of one’s own luck. His aspects are varied; some border on fanatical order, others thrive on pure chaos. Only one thing is certain when one worships an Aspect of the God of Fortune: Luck will be on your side--when you're lucky.
