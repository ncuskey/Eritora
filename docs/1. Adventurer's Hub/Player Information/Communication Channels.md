Dungeons & Dragons is, at its core, a social experience. In a typical campaign, a group of players schedules adventures specifically for their group. In a community campaign like ours, that is not as straightforward.

We have three primary tools to keep things simple: This website, a Discord server, and a DndBeyond Campaign.

### This Website
Here we have all of the general information you will need to understand the campaign, the setting, and your role in it. We have information on [[Turnbuckle Town]], non-player characters, [[Turnbuckle Town Business Directory|shops]], [[Overview|adventure companies]], [[Worship in the Land of Adventure|gods]], and much more available, including the D&D Fifth Edition rulesets. 

If you aren't sure about something, this is your first port of call. 

Additionally, the site hosts a very important feature: The [[Submit Content]] page. Although not necessary to be a part of our campaign, it is highly encouraged that you occasionally write a recap or review of an adventure you took, a magic item you found, or an NPC you met. More information can be found through the link.

### Discord
Our community Discord (https://discord.gg/Et3fYJyMDK) is the primary place to [[schedule your adventure]] and gather your party. It also provides an easy platform for remote play, should it be required, and general communication about anything, really. It's a great place to ask questions about information found on the site or about D&D in general.

#### The start-here Channel

It's in the name: start there. This channel provides information on the different channels available and what they are used for.

Additionally, upon joining please select the role you usually plan to fill--either Guide or Client. Simply click the relevant emoji here:

This will give your name a color in discord for easy role identification.

#### Bots

There are a selection of automated services found within the Discord. All are colored purple.

The Avrae bot can provide you with information on nearly anything in Dungeons & Dragons and is connected with DnDBeyond (see below), so it is capable of importing your characters and all kinds of other cool things.

Type `!help` in the avrae-bot channel to learn about what this bad boy can do. It's a lot!

The Apollo bot, found in the event-bothole channel, is our primary means of scheduling and filling out parties:

Creating events will be handled by the Dungeon Master for that particular adventure. Don't forget to sign up to your own adventure!

Don't worry about the Reaction Roles bot.

### D&D Beyond
This is the official Wizards of the Coast site for Dungeons & Dragons: www.dndbeyond.com.

It has information on everything in the game--if you own the relevant product. Fortunately for you (praise be unto Tychos) you will have access to almost everything important when you join the campaign using this link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/join/74494731777028575.

 This is the easiest way to create and manage your characters for the campaign. Simply create one inside the campaign and use whatever options are available to you. If you are interested in something that is *not* available within the materials shared in the campaign, contact a Dungeon Master and perhaps something can be worked out.
