### Building a Brand

[[Turnbuckle Town]] relies on its [[Overview|Adventure Companies]] to keep the city afloat. The [[CAd]]s must continually improve their offerings to keep pace with the interests of the wealthy elite. The most prestigious clients only work with the most prestigious [[CAd]]s ([[AD Venture]] primarily), and the most prestigious [[CAd]]s only hire the most prestigious adventurers to serve as [[Guide Services of Turnbuckle Town|guides]]. 

If you wish to work for the highest-level organizations in [[Turnbuckle Town]]–and earn the most coin–you must make a name for yourself.

Fame and recognition are tracked using a simple system of Prestige Score (PS). Different types of characters ([[Guide Services of Turnbuckle Town|Guides]], [[Character Earnings and Budgets#^b9567a|Clients]]) have similar tracks to attain PS. Your character starts at a PS of 1, and can achieve a maximum of 100. Some organizations and CAds require a certain amount of PS before they will entertain contracting with you. Others do not. Some individual adventures will have PS requirements, but not all. As with just about anything in Dungeons and Dragons, exceptions can be made. The last word belongs to the DM. 

Keep in mind that your Prestige Score is not analogous to your character’s level–situations may arise where you need to push beyond your character’s limits to gain PS. In such a case, hiring another character may be wise!

All PS is bound to an individual character, not player.

### As a Guide

As a [[Guide Services of Turnbuckle Town|guide]], you are rated based on the success of your contracts. This includes achieving objectives and keeping your clients safe. In addition, you are scored on your ability to keep the customer’s desires in mind. Did Fabulous Joe manage to kill a wight by his own hand? Was The Magnate’s gilded robe kept clear of mud and blood splatters? Did Sous Chef Bernard find the ingredients the head chef requires for tonight’s soirée?

What constitutes a successful contract can change based on the circumstances. Rest assured, your DM will inform you as to how successful you were, as will any clients you are guiding. If you have questions calculating the amount of PS gained at the conclusion of an adventure, ask your DM.

##### Guide PS Scoring:

- Successful Contract: 3 to 5 PS, based on difficulty. (DM’s discretion).
- Moving Up: 1 PS each time the first contract at a higher tier is completed successfully.
- Failed Contract: -3 to -5 PS, depending on how embarrassing and/or devastating the failure is. (DM’s discretion). 
- Client Review
	- 1 to 3 PS if the client enjoyed things (felt safe, pampered, achieved personal objective, etc.)
	- -1 to -3 PS if the client did not (Rudeness, unnecessary danger, poor accommodations, etc.)
- High Profile Guide: 1 PS if the client is particularly noteworthy.
- Punching Down: -1 PS for taking a contract two or more tiers below your PS.

### As a Client

As a [[client]], you are rated based on your ability to stay in control and/or follow directions. First time clients will be run through the [[Adventurer Assessment]] in order to determine their starting PS and level. This could involve communicating your personal objectives to your guides and staying on track. As a Client, many things can be smoothed over with a simple transfer of coin. At the right price, Cranky Ben may be willing to open up a side passage along your journey. Slaughter Matthews may be willing to throw himself at a pair of unnecessary [[Ettin]]s so you can grab a Fancy Perfume from one of their sacks. Claudio may be willing to sign an autograph. 

#### Client/Guide Requirements
It is recommended that an adventuring party contains both [[Guide]]s as well as [[Client]]s, but it is not a requirement--Clients are more than welcome to throw caution to the wind and take on an adventure on their own, and Guides are certainly able to go out on an adventure without a Client to worry about.

However, as explained in [[Guides and Clients]] each type of character is an important factor in our gaming ecosystem.

CAds have the final say on which parties they will allow on their adventures. Some adventures may be too dangerous for Clients to go on their own, or too expensive for Guides to participate in without Client funding.

##### Client PS Scoring:

- Successfully survived an adventure: 1-3 PS, based on difficulty. (DM’s discretion).
- Completed personal objective: 1-3 PS, based on difficulty. (DM’s discretion).
- Moving Up: 1 PS the first contract at a higher tier is completed successfully.
- Guide Review
	- 1 to 3 PS. Followed directions, stayed on course, paid if additional services requested, etc.
	- -1 to -3 PS. Intentionally made things difficult for the guides. Coin may buy forgiveness.
- Frivolous Spending: -1 PS for purchasing an adventure two or more tiers below your PS.

### Prestige Tiers

The organizations that are willing to contract with you can be easily determined by looking at the tiers. Depending on the organization/situation/what the DM wants to do/etc, requirements may change for certain activities.

Tier I ([[Novice]]): 1-14 PS

Tier II ([[Journeyman]]):  15-39 PS

Tier III ([[Adept]]): 40-74 PS

Tier IV ([[Exemplar]]): 75-99 PS

Tier V ([[Legend]]): 100 PS

The factors involved in the selection of [[Questings]] participants is a closely guarded secret, but it’s known that invitees are nearly always adventurers that have worked their way towards the top end of the scale.
