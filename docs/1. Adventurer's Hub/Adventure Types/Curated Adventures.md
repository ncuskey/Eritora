Curated Adventures are the bread and butter of the CAds. It's right there in the name, after all. These can range from a quick pick from a menu of standard options to bespoke, exclusive one-offs for those wealthy customers looking to separate themselves from the rest. Even the most basic Curated Adventure can be customized with a gold deposit of sufficient magnitude--coordinate with your Dungeon Master! Surprise your friends! Try and kill one! (Don't do that... or do! Everything's got a price...)

#### Selection

Each CAd offers a selection of basic adventures. Don't expect an adventure from [[Goblin Games]] to run through the same magical cavern as one [[Dungeon Disasters LLC]] has access to, as all Curated Adventures are run on company property.

The requirements to enter each Curated Adventure will be clearly displayed on that adventure's information page. Some adventures will have PS requirements, but none will have level requirements--enter at your own risk. 

The adventures offered by the CAds will be listed on their own individual pages. The cost for the adventure is on a per-party basis--one Client can foot the bill for the entire operation, or several can split it. It's entirely up to the party. 

#### Negotiation

All Curated Adventures are ready to run without worrying about any of this, as long as they are paid for in advance.

However, the Client paying for the adventure does have the ability to negotiate with the Dungeon Master on any point they wish.

The most common type of negotiation is about the share of the loot that the Client obtains. In a standard adventure, whatever loot is gathered is split equally amongst the Clients and their Guides. However, the paying Client can pay an increased amount to ensure they get a higher share. With sufficient coin, this could range all the way up to 100% of the loot winding up in their pockets.

There are no set prices for this. It must be negotiated with your Dungeon Master *before* the adventure begins, and the cost is added onto your bill.

Negotiations don't have to end there, however. As mentioned above, feel free to customize your adventure however you please. The Dungeon Master will let you know the costs. They may be prohibitively high. Or they might be great ideas and will be provided for free. 

#### Custom Adventures

Every CAd does their best to cater to the elite. It's a well-known fact that the vast majority of their incomes comes from the pockets of the wealthy, and the more loyalty a CAd can earn from those of means the better it is for their bottom line.

To this end, they are happy to create and prepare entirely new experiences for the right price.
